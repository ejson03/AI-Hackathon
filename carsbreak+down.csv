"An Idiot's Guide to BMW's lineup (because someone asked and I just finished up my day at work)
In a recent post giving a breakdown of McLaren's current lineup, there was a request to make one for BMW because their naming conventions are confusing as hell. Since I'm bored at work now that I'm done for the day, I decided to try and tackle it. 
EDIT: forgot to mention that this is based on their current lineup. 
To start off, BMW for the most part orders its cars by an orderly odd/even numbering pattern. I'm sure most of you in this subreddit already understand that, but let's just break it down as a warm-up.
Models **starting with odd numbers** have **4 doors**. Your average run-of-the-mill sedan/saloon and passenger car that can carry all your friends and all the groceries for your barbecue. As I'm sure you know, as the numbers go up, the cars get bigger, nicer, and more powerful. They are:
* 1 series (except the pre-2013 1-series which was a coupe and was before BMW really set their naming convention in stone. Let's forget that exists)
* 3 series
* 5 series
* 7 series
Models **starting with even numbers** have **2 doors**. Think of them as the sporty, stylish version of the their 4-door counter-parts. Just add 1 to the model number of a 4-door and that will be the 2-door equivalent.
* 2-series
* 4-series
* 6-series
* (coming in the future) 8-series
""But /u/AkagisWhiteComet"", you ask, ""there's so many other BMWs that start with Zs, Xs, and Is!"" Do not fear, those are easy too.
* Z (i.e. Z3, Z4) - 2 door roadsters. That's it
* X (X3, X4, X5, X6) - SUVs & crossovers, also that get bigger and nicer as the number goes up
* M (Mmmmmmm high performance)
* i - eco-friendly electric/hybrids
After this was established, BMW decided, ""fuck it, let's make more 4-door versions of our 2-door cars and estate versions of our 4-door cars and how about some weird SUV/saloon combination?"" That's where words like Gran Turismo/Gran Coupe/Active Tourer, etc. all come in.
* Touring: just a station wagon/estate version of their 4-door cars
* Gran Turismo: weird SUV/saloon combinations (3-series Gran Turismo, 5-series Gran Turismo)
* Gran Coupe: 4-door versions of a 2-door car just so that you can keep that sleek coupe style (4-series Gran Coupe, 6-series Gran Coupe)
* Active Tourer: there's just one, a 2-series Active Tourer, which is just a 5-door hatchback. This one bastard ruins an otherwise consistent naming convention.
Keep all of these in mind because this is the only decoder you need to unlock your new knowledge. Now let's start playing with numbers.
What's the deal with a 328i, 540d, X3 M40i, etc., you ask? The numbers used to reference engine displacement (or close enough to it), but has since lost some meaning, considering the 328i is a 2.0L turbo I4, the 330i is still a turbo I4. At this point, there are 4 engine types for their models that start with numbers. All are turbos and have 4, 6, 8, or 12 cylinders. They are (courtesy of /u/-tripleu):
* 20i - turbo I4, cheapest engine option for 3 series (in US)
* 28i - at first a NA I6, but then turbo I4
* 30i - replaces the 28i with a new turbo I4
* 35i - at first a twin turbo I6, but then single turbo I6
* 40i - replaces the 35i with a new single turbo I6
* 50i - twin turbo V8 (5, 6, 7 series)
* 60i - twin turbo V12 (7-series)
So, the difference between a 328i and 335i? 328i is a 3-series with a turbo I4, 335i is a 3-series with a turbo I6, that's it! Now that's settled, let's get into the numbers **behind** the numbers. For instance, what's the difference between a 330i and a 330e? That's simple too:
* i: gasoline-powered
* d (i.e. 330d, 540d) - diesel-powered
* e (i.e. 330e, 530e) - plug-in hybrid
* xDrive - 4 wheel drive
* L (i.e. 760Li) - long wheelbase
Let's finish this off strong. Now, this naming convention so far has worked with cars that *start with numbers*. But now let's say you have a X3 that is Mmmmm high performance (M) and has a single turbo I6 (40i). You can't put ""M"" in front like the M3 or M5 because ""MX340i"" doesn't flow. For these cars, BMW has moved all the other descriptors to *behind* the model name. In this case, the X3 M40i is born.
That's it! In summary, everything that comes after the model name is just an additional descriptor of that exact model. M760Li Individual? Just a long wheelbase 7-series with a twin turbo V12, sportier ""M"" package, and with a BMW Individual trim package. What's the X6 xDrive40D? Just a 6-cylinder diesel X6 with 4 wheel drive.
Hope this helped some people. I'm by no means a BMW expert but I figured that with often hearing people complaining about the confusion of BMWs lineup, this would be at least a slightly informative yet lighthearted post that helped solve some confusion.",2

"My takeaways from driving 1300 miles in a brand new rental Miata through Southern Germany (and the alps!).
My girlfriend decided to do a semester abroad in Cologne, Germany. When she told me she was doing this, I planned on visiting. When I planned on visiting, I planned on renting a car.
I drive stick every day, which turned out to be good. My only options without driving stick were some flavor of Citroen or Peugeot hatchback (according to the SIXT website).
You will be shocked to know I did not want either of these cars.
I couldn't get anything super nice, (because I'm 21 and they're right not to trust me), so I really had two choices. A 1 series hatch, or an ND Miata.
I know. You can't get a 1 series hatch in the US yadayadayada... but I have driven 1 series before. I know what they're like. I didn't want a hatchback.
What I did want was a convertible, and the Miata checked that box. My other convertible options were an A3 convertible, and a Beetle convertible. Both of which fall under the category of, ""The salesman said plenty of dudes buy it!"" The same goes for the Miata, but I feel like those other cars are worse in this regard.
Surprisingly when we went to pick up the car, all of the available MX-5s were automatic. I stressed to the guy at the desk I would much prefer a stick. He explained he didn't really understand because apparently in Europe most people prefer automatic transmissions. I guess it's the same in the US but I didn't really expect it.
Apparently he liked me though, because after some muttering in German to his coworkers, he unreserved the only stick Miata on the lot from somebody who was going to pick it up in a few hours, and gave it to me. Guy was honestly a hero. Sounded a lot like Sebastian Vettel too.
As it turns out, this particular Miata was literally brand spanking new. It had 14km on it (like 8 fucking miles). I was the first person to actually drive it.
After figuring out how to open the trunk, I realized how pathetically small it was. We only had two carry on sized bags and they barely fit. We had to put the one backpack we also had with us behind the headrests where the top folds into. The only other place to store things was a little box between the seats.
[The ""gun box"".](https://imgur.com/CPYT5r0)
I called this box ""the gun box"". The only thing it seemed like it was large enough to hold was a handgun. It was too small for a laptop or anything. We ended up keeping a bag of pretzels in it, as handguns are hard to come by in Germany.
Our first stop was the city of Trier, near the border of Luxembourg. The birth place of Karl Marx! I wasn't there for any share-your-shit convention, though.
[The ""Porta Nigra"".](https://imgur.com/GtHbjpP)
Trier was a major Roman city in the province of Gaul. There's still a lot of ruins from that era laying around, including the very impressive Porta Nigra, or Black Gate. It is the original city gate constructed around 170 AD. Not bad for a bunch of Italians. Apparently it was at one point converted into a church of some kind, and then Napoleon visited Trier in 1804 and said something along the lines of, ""change it back"".
[I just thought this was kind of odd.](https://imgur.com/gK8LaPc)
The people in Trier seemed to like Americans the most out of any of the places we went. I don't think they get a lot of international tourism. The waitress at the restaurant we ate lunch at kept busting my balls about what kind of pizza to get. She apparently learned English from watching *Grey's Anatomy*. It seems to me like if you crack a few casual jokes to most German people, they think you're like a cool American, and then the whole interaction is very pleasant.
[A panorama of Trier. The closer bridge crossing the river is also an original Roman article.](https://imgur.com/jPzxptq)
The city of Trier has some small mountains across the river which provide a very nice view of the city.
[The roads weren't bad either.](https://imgur.com/3caoCco)
 Sometimes it was hard to tell whether you were on an actual road or some German's driveway. The Miata was plenty small enough for the petite roads, and was so far about as good as my expectations.
The clutch feel is excellent for a stock car, and as good as any new car I've driven. The pickup on it was predictable, and the feedback through the pedal was good. Felt better than a Focus ST.
Coming from an E46 M3, the size and weight of the pedal made it sort of feel like a little toy. Not in a bad way though. The shifter is fantastic and provides an amount of feedback that I can only compare to my 1974 BMW 2002. It was both refreshing and relieving to feel the amount of reassuring, handshake-like confidence I got from it. I always knew everything I wanted to know about the transmission when I changed gears. Nothing about it felt rubbery, dishonest or disconnected.
The throw was just about perfect. The flywheel felt a little heavy coming from an M3, but it was a really nice balance. The engine was loud enough for me to not have to stare at the tachometer to know when to change gears, too. That really burns my ass when a car is so quiet you don't know when to shift.
[The Miata was just the right size for tight German backroads.](https://imgur.com/u1eg2fl)
I think the car looks great too. Definitely the best looking Miata so far. If the car wants to break its 'hairdressery' image, this is a giant leap in the right direction. I think it looks aggressive and even a little exotic without looking as furious as many new cars do. Any aggression displayed in its little Miata face is definitely justified too, as the engine is a punchy unit (this is not all I will say about the engine).
[This square was eerily quiet as there were no roads that allowed cars anywhere near it. Very strange compared to say, any city in the US.](https://imgur.com/9ovirh3)
Overall I think Trier was a quaint, quiet little city that I liked a fair bit. Our hotel was like an old monastery or something right on the river. Really nice and very inexpensive. Beats the shit out of staying in some sweaty hostel with 30 dudes named Fritz and some ditsy college girls from University of Tampa. I know this isn't a travel sub or anything, I'm just trying to give my opinion here.
[""Pickelmann""](https://imgur.com/gW6zVnq)
From Trier (the birthplace of Karl Marx!) we headed five and a half hours south to the town of Füssen in southern Germany, right on the border with Austria. I told my girlfriend to take a picture of the Picklemann truck because I call my dog pickle man.
[He looks like a pickle man, right?](https://imgur.com/YUJiyMK)
This trip from Trier to Füssen was the first time I had ever been on the autobahn, something I honestly didn't even think about when I rented the car.
[The view from our Airbnb in Füssen.](https://imgur.com/ehQaCai)
A lot of people have the impression that the Autobahn is like, one big wide road that goes through Germany and you can do 200mph on it all the time. In truth, the Autobahn is a lot like the interstate highway network back in the states. Most of the autobahn I drove on was delimited. The speed limits in the restricted areas are typically around 100kph to 130 kph (about 60 to 80 mph), so pretty reasonable. Most people abide by them, too. It isn't abundantly clear when the derestricted areas start in some cases, though.
Sometimes there are signs that look like a regular speed limit sign that is just greyscale with lines through it. That basically means it's open season. However, sometimes the speed limit signs just end, and you don't realize its not restricted until Klaus rips by you in a sprinter van at 130 mph. The fastest most people go is around 130mph. The fastest I saw somebody go was two guys outside of Stuttgart in an SLR Stirling Moss. I didn't realize how rare the car was at the time, or even what it was, so I didn't order my girlfriend to take a picture. That was about as fast as I've ever seen a car go on a public road. Thing took off like a cartoon and must have hit 180mph.
When I got my chance in the Miata, I would typically floor it in 5th or 6th gear and cruise at 160kph (around a hundred miles per hour). You learn a few things about the Mazda Miata when you do this:
1. The engine may be punchy, but it doesn't seem to like being wrung out like a soaked rag. It didn't exactly sound like it was in pain, but it didn't seem to like it. (I will speak even more about the engine later).
2. It is loud.
The convertible top allows a considerable amount of noise in, but this is just a problem with all soft top convertibles. My M3 is worse. At one point on the arrow straight highway to Füssen I had the speedometer pinned at 240kph for about half an hour. It was deafeningly loud, but we made some really good time. If I could've gotten a stick RF, I would have. The Miata always felt stable and poised at these speeds however, and I never felt like the thing was going to start breaking up or anything. Having the ability to just haul ass down the highway is something I miss about Germany. It was a little alarming at first but once you get used to it, it's fantastic. People take driving a lot more seriously on the highway in Germany.

We went to Füssen because of the Castle situation, and it did not disappoint.
[Neuschwanstein Castle is the key attraction.](https://imgur.com/9xouer4)
Ever see that like really 'castly' looking castle? This is it. It was actually built around 1900 by the King of Bavaria. I think he was a King. I'm not sure what the exact translation is for his title. Anyway, according to Wikipedia he spent all his dough on it and no one knew what to do with this guy. He died under some pretty fishy circumstances. Literally weeks after this guy kicked the bucket his successor had it opened for paid tours. Guy was practically still warm when they started bussing in Chinese tourists by the thousands.
The castle isn't a defensive fixture at all, it was far too late for that. It's really a sort of romanticized palace. Many of the towers and whatnot are just decorative. You cannot go in them.
[A view of one of the courtyards. Going inside had a 3 day wait list that we were not on. Can't take pictures inside anyway.](https://imgur.com/b0ZrQ99)
[Some of it was under scaffolding, and these port windows were covered in, you guessed it: Plywood! Couldn't have painted it grey, or something?](https://imgur.com/65LfhOh)

After spending a few days wandering around the town and the castles with the lovely people of Shenzen, we decided to drive to Berchtesgaden. You know, where Hitler's house is? Apparently it's a restaurant now.
[A picture on the way along the Alps.](https://imgur.com/SvJ50T7)
The way from Füssen to Berchtesgaden was a pretty nice trip. Almost all of the roads in Germany are perfectly paved. If they aren't, there's roadwork going on to make it that way (for better and for worse).
[A backroad Maps took us down.](https://imgur.com/aKjIKr6)
That didn't really matter though, because the Miata rode just about perfectly. Maybe it's just from driving the M3 so much, but every bump I hit expecting to be jostled around was handled perfectly. The MX-5 has the perfect balance of sporty and comfortable, and I've searched a long time for a car that has that. The steering is also great, especially considering it's an electric rack. I remember reading all of this electric steering alarmism when the car was first coming out. People running around with their hair on fire like, ""IT HAS FUCKING ELECTRIC STEERING! PACK IT UP!"" [Like the scene in Spongebob where he forgets his name.](https://youtu.be/tZQJhvs4amQ) It's bullshit. It feels just as good or better than the benchmark, cheap sports car Focus ST, and almost as good as my M3, which is saying a lot. Could it be better? Yeah. A hydraulic rack would just be better, but it's not worth complaining about. For reference to another modern car, this chassis and steering feels better than the M235i. It feels more tactile, it feels more tied down, and I felt more confident behind the wheel as a result.
[German people seem to really like stacking wood very neatly. All of the stacked firewood I saw looked flawless.](https://imgur.com/YAKKDbl)
[The scenery around Berchtesgaden was stunning.](https://imgur.com/AhaaRC6)
After we arrived at the bus stop to take us up to Hitler's eagles nest, we found it it was closed. After getting over the fact that we weren't going to get a cheeseburger in Hitler's living room, we decided to cross the alps the Salzburg.
Thank god we went to Salzburg.
[The road over the Alps.](https://imgur.com/rUzfocE)
I found this road on Google Maps that looked incredible. My girlfriend thought it was going to be like a cowpath or something. It was not. It was about thirty minutes worth of heaven tier alpine road. Definitely the best drive of my life. I would say it was worth the 8 dollar toll.
[The view from the top of the road.](https://imgur.com/UanIR0r)
[The road was very well maintained.](https://imgur.com/j163P8p)
The way up was really great, it was the only time during the trip I really noticed the Miata having any kind of lack of power (I had the 2 liter engine). Most of the time I was in second or third gear. I said I would address the engine, so here it is. I'm not gonna be some contrarian dope and be like, ""THE MIATA HAS PLENTY OF POWER FOR WHAT IT IS, I AKCHUALLY THINK ITS A LOT!""
If 1 is ""dog shit"" slow, 5 is adequate power, and 10 is alarmingly quick, the Miata is somewhere between 5 and 6. The engine has a nice enough mid range, but it never climbs onto its cams or anything. At low RPM it sounds positively agricultural. It sounds like it should have a PTO under the rear bumper. It doesn't really sound great at any rpm. It also doesn't sound bad though. It's just ""an engine"". The only interesting noise it made was some kind of gear whine noise in the mid-range that was very faint. The adequate levels of power, and adequate noise it produces make it nothing to speak of. It's punchy, its responsive, but it's really nothing to talk about. This is kind of a let down, and not really an issue at the same time.
[Another view from the top.](https://imgur.com/TIG1SSs)
That being said, I feel blessed I had it up in the Alps. I wouldn't have wanted to be in a 1 series, or an A3, or something. It was the perfect car for the job. The chassis is as nearly perfect as I can imagine. The brakes' stopping power felt good, and the pedal itself felt great and provided excellent feedback. Some people complain about body roll. I didn't notice any alarming amounts of body roll. I thought it was just fine. It's an extremely rewarding car to drive near the limit.

[A panorama of the city from the castle.](https://imgur.com/Im9sOOH)
We returned to Füssen that night along the regular Autobahn. It began to rain while we were in Salzburg, which translates to snow up in the Alps. I still feel really lucky I got to do that drive at all. I was smiling the entire time. If you have a chance to drive over the Alps in anything close to a Miata, fucking do it. You will not regret it. You'll remember the sights, the smells, the feeling of the alpine air, the gear changes... Everything. You know that feeling when your mouth starts to hurt after you've been laughing so much? I felt that from the constant grin on my face for nearly an hour. Anybody who likes cars for any reason has to do it. Make sure you have the top down.
[""That is an ALP!""](https://imgur.com/dSl1go7)
On the drives during the following days back around Füssen, I had some time to really reflect on driving the Miata. I thought about how the car felt during cornering, under braking, under acceleration, everything. Was the steering actually good? Is the engine anything special? How did the car ride on this road? I had two more days with the car, and decided to wander into Austria again after dinner for a final backroad shakedown.
[A windy road though a valley in the Alps.](https://imgur.com/XAaG399)
[A beautiful lake we found on Miata Maps. Austria is a really great country. Foods not bad either.](https://imgur.com/Y85U5im)
The Miata is the best new car I have driven, period. It is the only new car that has reminded me of the way an older car drives, which was very surprising. Almost every new car I have driven feels like... It feels like there's a little person making all of the decisions between everything you try to do, and what the car actually does.
It didn't have steering that felt like there was a massive rubber bushing in it. The gear change didn't feel synthetic at all. It felt direct and mechanical. The engine (although not anything to write home about) was linear and predictable. Everything the driver touched to operate this car felt extremely well sorted out. It's just the little things that got to me. I convinced myself I could never actually buy this car. The trunk was comically useless, there was almost no storage anywhere else, it could only seat one other person, and it was well... not fast.
What else did I not like? I'll cut to the chase.
[Fuck the start-stop system on this car. To death.](https://imgur.com/KTxfQXc)
The start-stop system on this car, or ""i-stop"" was positively the most annoying thing during the entire trip. For some reason, it does not have memory. What do I mean? When you turn the car off, it resets. If you turn off start-stop, it will only last as long as the car is on. This may seem reasonable if nothing else has memory either, but other shit does.
What other shit? The fucking HEATED SEATS HAVE MEMORY and this shit doesn't. Who's fucking decision was that? The lane departure warning, which is also annoying and useless, has memory (the button right next to it). It also is the only button in the car that requires a long press to turn on or off. If you just press it, nothing happens. You have to hold it down for a few seconds for anything to happen, and there's nothing telling you that you have to do that. I only discovered it after getting pissed and just pushing the button as hard as I could, depressing that entire plastic region of the dashboard. You just know that somebody made the decision for this not to have memory, and whoever did that should be fucking put on trial. It was also one of the roughest starts I have ever felt in a car that has 'start-stop'. Felt and sounded like a diesel truck turning over. Shook the entire car almost alarmingly.
The car also has a blindspot monitor, which is very sensitive and very annoying. Maybe I just drive like an asshole, but it seemed like whenever I put my blinker on to change lanes, if a car was anywhere near the side of the Miata, it would start beeping. I could feel my blood pressure rising every time I considered changing lanes. Ever hear your phone's alarm during the day after you've woken up? After a while hearing those beeps felt like that.
[The rear view mirror.](https://imgur.com/XWmCnVo)
This car's rear view mirror also seemed pretty jacked up. There was a power button on it for some reason, I'm guessing it was for some sort of dimming, but I did not notice a difference when I hit the button. It also did not adjust so that I could actually see out of the rear window. I'm not a tall person. I'm like 5'10"". Maybe I'm just a moron, but I could not get the mirror to an adjustment where I could see behind me without slumping down in my seat a few inches. To me this must be some sort of fuck-up because there's no way they didn't figure that shit out. Seemed like a really obvious thing to get right. 
The coolant temp gauge on the dashboard was also not very easy to read, and the infotainment system looked like the home screen I had on my PSP when I was in middleschool.
The car beeps whenever you put it into reverse. Why? It has a reverse lockout. Reverse feels like its in another fucking state. I know I'm changing into reverse. Why does it beep? I feel like the president complaining about this shit.
""I asked my people, why does it beep? Why does it beep when its in reverse? They said we don't know! You hear it. When you change gears, it goes... Beep! I said, I know the car is in reverse. I put it there, you know, in reverse, and... Beep! Unbelievable. We gotta get smart, people! You see what they're doing! We have to get smart.""
To me it seems like they got everything about the driving experience so right, that the people who make cars annoying were like rubbing their palms ready to try and ruin it.
I'm finished complaining.
By the end of the trip, I knew where I stood with the car. I liked it a lot, it was everything I expected it to be. I wasn't in love with it, it was just a nice car to have for this little trip I went on, and nothing else. It was too impractical to buy, because it was just a useless little car to do anything besides drive in.
Then I had to return it.
[Another great little road in Austria.](https://imgur.com/2LdiB2E)
After 1300 miles, driving this car back to the airport, I had a pit in my stomach. It just happened. I did not want to give it back. It was a useless car! I still think it's useless! You cannot put ANYTHING or ANYBODY in it. In every day life, you basically can't take anyone anywhere, you can't carry shit, and you'll barely ever drive it. It would have to be a third or fourth car. Your friends will probably make fun of you for buying it too, at least, my friends would. They made fun of me for even renting it! Then I was thinking, well if its a third or fourth car, why not a used M3 or something? For Miata money you can have a much nicer used car. If you're barely ever gonna drive it the maintenance wont cost shit anyway. I kept running all of these scenarios though my head about all of the logical reasons why I could never have one. It's a car that's literally only useful for driving.
Then I realized, that's why I just didn't want to get rid of it.
It's only useful for driving.
It reminded me of a part of *James May, The Reassembler*, actually. [This part.](https://youtu.be/MrqI8dP3TIk?t=1126)
It's a simple thing. It's a car... that you can drive. That's the only reason for it's existence. *That's all it does.*
It kept me thinking that the people at Mazda who make the Miata must also understand this. That really it's a stupid thing. They completely understand how it's impractical, it's uncompromising, and it really isn't good at anything in day-to-day life. They get past all of that. Somebody explained all of that to them, explained to them why they couldn't make it, and they said, ""Fuck. You.""
I don't know. It makes me happy as a car guy.  It's a giant middle finger to the automobile being treated as an appliance. Supercars are an even bigger middle finger, but *anybody can buy a Miata.*
[Me and my new friend somewhere in the Alps](https://imgur.com/oKoJSkA)
I'm sure most of the people reading this have watched *Top Gear* or *The Grand Tour*. You know how sometimes they get a car on a roadtrip and they tell you it becomes like one of their friends? I always thought that was bullshit, because I couldn't relate. Now I know they are completely truthful when they said that. Every time I parked the car somewhere, I was thinking to myself. ""Will the Miata be safe here? How is the Miata?"".
[I would peek out my window and make sure it was okay.](https://imgur.com/nYL9uDq)
Changing gears DID feel like shaking hands with an old friend. It carried me down the autobahn quite happily at 150mph. It waited patiently in parking lots to take me on my next adventure. It welcomed every corner with enthusiasm, and every mountain road with poise and determination. It was like an excited puppy.
""Come on! Get in! Lets go drive! Where are we going?""
Taking it back to the rental place, I just felt like I was tying it to a post and leaving it. I felt like it was still wagging its tail behind me as I was walking away.
I just hope I gave it a good break-in, and I hope it has a lot of great miles ahead of it.",2

I have been daily-driving my 1995 NSX for about five years, starting in the Washington DC area, then in Honolulu, and now in southern California. Like my previous posts ([Year 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/6nstoy/some_pics_from_my_fourth_year_of_dailydriving_the/) | [Year 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/3yrg71/some_pics_from_my_third_year_of_dailydriving_the/) | [Year 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/2s3hiq/some_pics_from_my_second_year_of_dailydriving_the/) | [Year 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/1tkvgj/some_pics_from_my_first_year_of_dailydriving_the/)) here are some highlights.
We are in the [Los Angeles area](https://i.imgur.com/oihG9z7.jpg) now so I enjoy a lot of car-related perks.
* Access to [more capable shop options](https://i.imgur.com/Hsb7CsR.jpg) including ones that I used to only read about in magazines and tuner articles. I remember putting together “dream builds” on paper with lengthy mod lists and compiling the prices of all the parts and even putting all the contact info down, like I was gonna call up the shop any second hahaha but a corner balance and alignment at [West End](https://i.imgur.com/msZaFrE.jpg) was always the finishing touch.
* [Canyon carving](https://i.imgur.com/0cqT7Yel.jpg) as a legitimate way to get from one place to another.
* Similarly, one can also incorporate [a beachside cruise](https://i.imgur.com/8tHhLVDl.jpg) into their drive.
* The weather isn’t *always* nice though. For example, [back in early January](https://i.imgur.com/Di6NiwNl.jpg) it was colder than usual so I had to go get a hot chocolate at In-N-Out to offset having the roof off. This was very popular with my East coast friends experiencing Snowmaggedon Part 3 or whatever it was. 
* Getting lost is a legitimate way to [end up somewhere for a good picture](https://i.imgur.com/7xlsXC1l.jpg).
[NSXPO 2017](https://i.imgur.com/3b8sap3.jpg) was at [Road America in Wisconsin](https://i.imgur.com/XCk2jm4.jpg) last year. Because I actually had the NSX on the US mainland this time, I was determined to go although the timing was problematic for several reasons:
* [Of course it rained in San Diego](https://i.imgur.com/2RJtv35.jpg) during the exact two day window I had set aside for prepping the car for the trip. I learned special (stupid) techniques for polishing and waxing in the rain.
* Once I was finally on the road, driving by myself proved to be a mixed blessing. Staying awake on long stretches was tough but it also meant I could stop [pretty much anywhere](https://i.imgur.com/srxquzc.jpg) for a bathroom break, whenever I needed.
* I stopped by at [Mile High Acura in Denver](https://i.imgur.com/GGzsdJ3.jpg). Back in 1995, the original owner of my car [purchased this NSX here for $81K](https://i.imgur.com/Eg5Wohf.jpg). I, on the other hand, got pictures and an oil change. NSXPO itself was amazing, as usual.
* The highlight for me was Ted Klaus (head honcho of the second-gen NSX project) coming over during the [NSXPO concourse](https://i.imgur.com/1melv5il.jpg) and remarking on the subtle but probably very effective modifications I had done. That was equivalent in my mind to winning a trophy for best daily driven NSX.
* Back to that bad timing thing: immediately after the event (actually had to cut the banquet dinner short), we had to blast across the country to make it to a work-related event in Seattle. We could afford [one stop in Wyoming](https://i.imgur.com/HK4IvWml.jpg). I used the time to wash the car. And sleep! I slept too.
* The drive back down to southern California was much more relaxed and included more stops, including [a day at Crater Lake in Oregon](https://i.imgur.com/fKHcYVGl.jpg). This was during that “whole Pacific Northwest is on fire” thing though, so I didn’t get a crisp clear lake background. It was, however, a good place to roll [200K](https://i.imgur.com/621ywW8l.jpg) miles.
* NSX owners and enthusiasts: NSXPO 2018 is in San Francisco this year, the last week of September. See you there!
Besides NSXPO, I’m still going on lots of other road trips.
* Las Vegas is probably the easiest, especially during [NSX West Fest ](https://i.imgur.com/4X5LvM2l.jpg). This year’s event was a little bigger than last year’s I think, or at least there were definitely more second-gens. It’s always a great way to get back in touch with [SW region NSX drivers](https://i.imgur.com/whxp6yBl.jpg).
* And of course I go to [San Diego](https://i.imgur.com/YOJYXtkl.jpg) a lot. It’s close by, and [my kid likes to hang out with my dad](https://i.imgur.com/DE5qz3Ol.jpg).
* Business trips too. I’m driving to those sometimes but even then I still bring enough gear to do a [parking lot car wash session](https://i.imgur.com/gdYS4QFl.jpg).
Sometimes, I need to fly to get to places even though I try really hard to justify driving instead. Even when I fly though, I am always down to do car shit.
* [In the DC area](https://i.imgur.com/aDNZjpBl.jpg) after a long day of meetings.
* [In Honolulu](https://i.imgur.com/7Tq0z8ol.jpg) on the way home from vacation.
* But I’ve made the mistake of forgetting to unbolt my battery for longer trips, making for an embarrassing [recovery effort](https://i.imgur.com/38aqcMRl.jpg) when I get back. Unrelatedly, my wife got a Tesla Model 3 and that definitely looks a lot better plugged in than my NSX.
Always feels good to get back [home](https://i.imgur.com/xFUopDQl.jpg) though, and do the daily-driving thing.
* [Still going to Costco](https://i.imgur.com/OBldWwBl.jpg[/img]). I’m not gonna give away the specific secret but there are particular mods that can be done that greatly reduce heat buildup inside the trunk. I am pretty confident now that I can bring ice cream home from the grocery store even if I put it in there.
* Yep, I am still often at [IKEA](https://i.imgur.com/uqDX2t9l.jpg). The one nearby is the largest in the US.
* It’s a little tougher for me to make it out to [area NSX meets on weekends](https://i.imgur.com/FSaBpC9l.jpg) now but I still try to do different [Cars and Coffee events](https://i.imgur.com/NNqFtjDl.jpg) whenever I can and I usually manage to make it out to regular [night meets](https://i.imgur.com/104ujmZl.jpg) too.
* Daily driving means I am back to [burning through rear tires](https://i.imgur.com/5uJOUoIl.jpg). Kinda sucks… but worth it.
* [No good caption](https://i.imgur.com/EpwnxJal.jpg) for this. I just wanted to show everyone a cool picture I took.
Speaking of cool pictures, I discovered a style of photography/vibe/music I really like (thanks, r/outrun). Natural choice for a 90s mid-engine sportscar with pop-up headlights. Plus it’s a good excuse to go out driving at night for pretty much no reason at all.
* My [first pics](https://imgur.com/wPnvNAP) weren’t that great.
* But I have gotten progressively [better](https://i.imgur.com/0px4u3d.jpg) I think.
* As far as phone pics go, I like [this](https://i.imgur.com/uCGgx6l.jpg) the best.
Some stats from the year:
* 23.7 average MPG (0.6 MPG better than last year)
* 28.2 highest MPG (2.6 MPG better than last year)
* 20.2 lowest MPG (1.8 MPG better than last year)
* 64.4 miles per day
Conclusion: being on the US mainland is unsurprisingly much better on MPG than being on Oahu. Comparing my SoCal MPG to what I was experiencing in northern Virginia though, I think there is something to be said about the forced low speed limits and the effect it has on fuel efficiency. I am happy to pay a little extra for fuel and treadwear life to drive LA/SD twisties though.
Hope you enjoyed the pics; I took all of them myself and I try to be fairly active on Instagram (@nsxlife) as well.",2
"Not a dream car, and nothing exciting. But a new(ish) car for someone who works their fingers to the bone.
Like the title, my new(ish) car is a blessing. 
Elantra https://imgur.com/gallery/MqknV
2015 Hyundai elantra with 30k on it is a YUGE step-up for someone whos last vehicle was a 98 blazer with 220k.
Blazer   https://imgur.com/gallery/XndJq
 Loved that truck, bought it for $1,600 with 170k, did all of the maintenance myself, even putting a newer used 4l60E in when the old one went out. But it had to go, as someone with a family now, two year old, a fiancè who has spina bifida and a mother with cancer it became impractical.
Now for anyone whos like ""yooo bruh shits lit but people but people buy cars everyday"" Well yes but it means something to me, for a good chunk of my short existence I've been abused, homeless, held a full time job(s) since 15 and school. I've had to fight for everything. This felt like a weight lifted off of me, one less thing to break down, one less thing to worry about. Maybe not an interesting post compared to some here, but it felt good to get it out i writing as to why im ecstatic about this car.
EDIT: Holy shit this blew up! Thank you guys!

"My car has been in 14 accidents from many fender benders to 3 major wrecks. It has been hit by an 18-wheeler and in a major wreck on the freeway. Last night, it was put to rest as it performed its last service for me and saved my brother's life.
Hi all-
I just really wanted to post this because it is so incredible to me and I want this experience shared. It is a true testament to what amazing manufacturing can provide (or maybe just luck, I don't know, I'm not that kind of engineer).
My car was a 2007 Honda CR-V.  It had 120,000 miles on it, and I have owned it for nearly 12 years (bought brand new for my 15th birthday).  
I have the worst luck with cars.  THE WORST LUCK WITH CARS.   I have been in the car for more than 20 wrecks.  obviously the majority being fender benders.  I have been in the car with 5 different boyfriends over the course of my life when each totaled their cars.  I have only been at fault for 1 wreck (its not like I weaseled my way out or something they have all been cut and dry) I have been rear ended 6 times sitting still at a red light.  I legitimately have friends who wont let me in the car because they are convinced I am bad luck.     
This car has never so much as made a strange sound.  I have never in my life had an issue.  I have had to change the tires obviously, replace brake pads, etc.  but nothing has ever broken on it. Every piece of technology, AC, everything has worked perfectly through the entire life of the car.  
I realize this is not unusual, but 3 of the wrecks I have had with it have been major.  The axel has snapped and the side crushed in when I was T-Boned by an 18-Wheeler (It was not going too fast).  I was in a 4 car pile up on the freeway 2 days after I turned 16 when a truck bed liner flew out of a truck going 65 mph.  The marks on the median are still there from my car to this day, every other car was totaled but mine.  
Seriously, this car was so reliable.  I had my 100K mile tune up and the dealership said ""this car runs beautifully, I have no suggestions beyond the usual tune-up""   
Now to the story of what happened yesterday. My brother and I traded cars for the summer.  He was going to be driving 1500 miles to an internship in his pick-up so I offered to trade with him.  He would get better gas mileage and my Fiance and I just bought our first house so having a pick-up would help us a lot with projects.  
So yesterday morning, he called me upset.  He was driving around 45 mph through a green light and someone coming the other direction in an Explorer didn't yield to take a left and he t-boned them going full speed.  All of the airbags deployed and the car was destroyed.  The other person had moderate injuries from the glass, and had some really bad head and neck pain from the whip.   The other car was slammed into the traffic light pole.   
My brother didn't have a scratch on him, and not a single pane of glass shattered.  in fact- I have never had a single pane of glass shatter in any wreck I have been in that car.  
Here are the pics of the car: https://i.imgur.com/qfz0Dvj.jpg . 
I am fully convinced that this car is a miracle.  look how crushed the front and side are, and the drivers area is untouched. 
I was so shaken up for what could have been.  But really my heart is full because this has been an amazing experience with a car.   My brothers first sentence to me after was, ""I am buying this car for all of my children when they turn 16""
So thats my love song to the car I received as a present when I turned 15. 
I can't wait to buy my next one this weekend. :)
Edit:  **I am going to count the wrecks up I have been in the car for from my memory so I can be more clear.**  20 was an estimate. 
1.  My mom slid into a guard rail on ice
2.  One my mom was merged into and side swiped
3.  My mom's car was slightly hit when the car in front of us tried to pass someone and hit someone else head-on going the other way (that was very serious and someone nearly died, luckily my mom was a cop and knew what to do.  She pulled the unconscious person out of their car and did something, I was really little I dont remember)
4. My other brother had been mudding in his jeep and it was raining and he rear ended someone when they hit the brakes.  He was a fucking moron for that, but that will help him to remember what mudding does to your tires.    I was in the car and 15. 
5.  Freeway pile up I mentioned when I was 16.  A trunk bed liner flew out of a truck and 4 cars were involved by either being hit by it or swerving to miss it.  I swerved to miss it, the car behind me hit me from behind because she followed me and slammed me into the median, both of our cars went slightly sideways momentarily on the median and came back down.  Hers was bad.  She almost got hit getting out of the car because of her panic.  Luckily my mom was a cop and always said that people die getting out of their cars on the freeway after a wreck, so I grabbed her and pulled her aside, we were very lucky. 
6.  My friend backed my CRV into a brick wall while moving it in HS.
7.  Sitting still at a red light and someone rear ended me, various times.
8.  Sitting still at a red light and someone rear ended me, various times.
9.  Sitting still at a red light and someone rear ended me, various times.
10.  Sitting still at a red light and someone rear ended me, various times.
11.  Sitting still at a red light and someone rear ended me, various times.
12.  Sitting still at a red light and someone rear ended me, various times.
13.  Sitting still at a red light and someone rear ended me, various times.
14.  HS boyfriend was rear ended and totaled his car. 
15. BF #2 went fast over traintracks with me and ripped something under his car that meant it was leaking oil, he didnt notice so it destroyed the engine, totaling the car. 
16.  BF #3 backed into a car in the parking lot, they were both backing up and not looking.   His car was not totaled actually now that I think about it, so I was dramatic when I said it was all totaled.
17. BF #4 was rear ended in the rain.  Cheap car so it was totaled
18. BF #5 was also rear ended in the rain.  Cheap car so it was totaled.
19.  I was in a parking lot looking for a spot and an old man driving an 18-wheeler accidentally went pedal to the metal and t-boned me, major damage to my car. 
20.  I was in another parking lot also looking for a spot and I backed up and looked right and left and missed a car turning the corner and I hit him, totally my fault.  
21. Someone backed into my car when they went too far into an intersection and panicked.  I didn't have time to move, but honked too late.  No real damage to the cars. 
22. I was in another parking lot and some young kid wanted a spot and flipped it in reverse and backed into me, I was behind him, but didn't react fast enough which drove me to take defensive driving courses. 
23. My friend was driving my car and went off the road on a big turn and the bottom of my car slid on the street.  It did something to the underside of the car.  That wasn't bad but the damage was expensive, so I counted that as major. 
24. Someone ran a red light by accident and hit their brakes just in time to very very slightly t-bone me going through the green light.  
25.  We were on a 4-lane street and I said ""Hey lets stop at Mac's"" and my moron friend said ""Okay"" and merged without looking to make the turn for Macs in like milliseconds.  she hit a taxi.  We aren't friends anymore because she told me I should pay for the ticket because I said we should go to Mac's...
So the ACTUAL totals are:
14 wrecks in my car
25 wrecks total
I was the driver for 12 of them. 
1 I was at fault for 
3 were major
Edit 2:  Hey guys, I really appreciate all of the replies.  I am just going to blanket answer a bunch of these questions as my inbox is sort of blowing up with repeats.  
1.  I understand ""at fault"" doesnt mean I am not partially responsible, of course I could have reacted better in a few of these, but I have taken 2 defensive driving courses since these happened and genuinely try my best to be safe. I never want to hurt anyone.  a lot of these are skewed towards my first few years of driving.  I will always claim responsibility if it is mine to claim.  I have never tried to get money out of people or purposely caused wrecks.  I have never done a random break slam that caused any of these.
2.  If I am a passenger, and I didn't impede the drivers ability to drive or their attention, that wreck was not my fault.  Full stop.  
3.  Most of these were very very small and classifying them as wrecks may be confusing you. I counted any time my car or a car I was a passenger in hit or was hit by something it should not have been causing the 2 drivers to get out of their cars together and discuss damage even if it was only a dent and scratch.   
Most of y'all know that any amount of damage, however small, can cause problems in a car and the only point of including those is that it was a reliable car and didn't have that happen. 
4.  If your only contribution is to call me a shit driver or tell me I should never drive again, feel free to just upvote the other folks who have already done so. I cant just not drive anymore, sorry its necessary to get to my job.  If you sincerely believe I am somehow a danger to you, please feel free to leave tips I am always down for bettering myself.

"After trading my GT-R in for an i8.... 1yr - 10k miles later follow up
When I originally shared trading in my GT-R for an i8, there were some request for follow ups and what not as time goes on. Since I just hit 10k miles and the (almost) 1 year mark, figured this would be a good time for an update. Guess I can just break this down into a few main sections, but I can also answer any other questions as they come up!
The Good:
- No breakdowns (knock on wood)
- Total maintenance cost $46 (state inspection, wipers blades). Other cost like oil changes, brakes, etc are covered by BMW for the first 4 years.
- The electric range has not dropped off at all. Granted still early days, but I remember seeing some complaints from i3 owners about that.
- For my normal driving, I average about 32mpg, 85% city driving. My preference really seems to just always be in sport mode if not using pure electric mode. 
- For sitting in traffic, NOTHING beats having an option to use pure electric. The smooth power delivery make stop and go that much less aggravating.
- I wont be able to drive a car without a heads up display ever again. I give BWM lots of credit here, as it's extremely well executed. Speed, audio, nav, everything is shown as needed. You really have no reason to look anywhere else other than straight ahead.
- The interior has held up extremely well. I'd say my car is getting way above typical i8 use, and it still looks good as new. 
The Bad:
- I do wish it had a tad bit more power. It actually pulls great all the way to the 155mph limiter. But there are times where you wish you had just a bit more in the 25-70mph range. (when compared to something like my previous GT-Rs, or a 12c for example)
- Driver side door is starting to sag a bit. Still goes up fine, but you can push it up a few more inches. Not enough for me to complain to the dealer about, but just a note.
- The fuel lid has faulted twice. You have to press a button on the inside to ""prepare"" for it to be unlocked, and once done you press the lid to open it. Well it's failed twice there, and i've had to use the manual opener. Again, minor but still of note.
- Tires have ~5k miles left on them. It's expected of course, but it's one of the main things BMW does not cover. Quick estimated puts that at ~$1700 for all 4 with mounting.
- Trying to see someone out the rear passenger side is actually horrendous. Especially because people love to pace me in that spot looking at the car.  
Extra Thoughts:
- Storage space with the backseats is actually perfect for a 2 person road trip.
- You really have to be aware of those around you. I have no issues with people taking pictures/video/whatever of the car, but it gets a bit dicey when it's the driver doing it. I've had on numerous occasions people swerve into my lane because of it.
- 'Trunk' is literally useless. Use that space to give us MOAR POWAAA.
- Some wider wheels would be nice. I get why they went with the skinny setup, but it makes the car look like it skeps leg day.
- The car gets an insane amount of attention. While the GT-R got a good amount of attention, it was heavily those in the car world. But the i8 really captures the eyes of people across all walks of life. I know some people would hate that sort of thing, but it makes my day to make someone else's day by letting them checkout the car. So I try my best to be as approachable as possible and give people as much time as I can.
- I've personally relocated from Charlottesville, Va to Northern Va/Dc area recently-ish. As mentioned already, the car is very composed in stop/go traffic.
- Not specific to myself/my car, but the i8 could use a refresh at this point. Only thing i've seen BMW release are new colors... Where's the facelift, or THE DAMN SPYDER YOU'VE PROMISED FOR YEARS?
So there's some thoughts/updates... Feel free to ask any other questions, i'll be happy to answer what I can. I'll leave you with some pictures [for your viewing pleasure.](http://imgur.com/a/ih4z0)",2
"Is Volvo designing the best looking exteriors and interiors in the industry? The new V90 carries on the excellent design of the XC90.
If you're like me, you understand when a car is beautiful, but it can be difficult to understand why.  I will try to give some insight with my limited knowledge, hopefully those with more knowledge will chime in.
If we look at the [first shot](https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/pe13f0924rwit8xoynxu.jpg), Volvo's ""shoulders"" are [prominent](http://immagini.alvolante.it/sites/default/files/styles/editor_1_colonna/public/news_galleria/volvo-v90-2016-rendering.jpg?itok=TuOD07Ba).  These are excellent at reflecting light at different angles which makes a single color car reflect multiple shades of that color, highlighting the lines of the [car](http://cdn.bmwblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/volvo-v90-polestarrender-750x500.jpg).  
[](http://www.motortrend.com/news/volvo-xc60-iihs-small-overlap-crash-test/)That long nose not only looks great, but it allows Volvo to package the engine and subframe in a way that, not only keeps you from dying, but also keeps you from getting injured in nearly every [scenario](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGNpExcyfw4).  The small [overlap](http://www.autoblog.com/2013/11/07/volvo-xc90-iihs-top-safety-pick-plus-video/) is one of the hardest crash scenarios to engineer a car for because it requires a ""top down"" design.  In other words, the engineers need to be thinking ""safety"" from day 1, they can't try to reengineer a car to be safe on the back end.  [Notice](http://jalopnik.com/the-2016-volvo-xc90-monstered-americas-newest-crash-tes-1731483888) how the front wheel and suspension push the car away from the barrier, leaving the passenger compartment [untouched](http://www.carscoops.com/2015/09/new-volvo-xc90-masters-iihs-small.html).  Instead of breaking a leg (or losing it), the driver is walking away from it.  The car will do well in the other crash [tests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw64wdDQsFQ) as well.  Of course, Volvo has been doing this for decades.  Here is a [2014 XC90](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPL0Vi_8fiI), a decade old design at the time, doing wonderful on the small overlap test that the IIHS only started doing in 2014.  Volvo had been testing the small overlap for over 2 decades:
> Anders Kling, the stoic Volvo engineer monitoring everything, seems satisfied. IIHS’ testing is an open book, notes research engineer Becky Mueller, and car company representatives are invited to watch and ask questions. I ask Anders what’ll happen to the front wheel. “It’ll come off,” he says flatly. At this point, monitors from some Asian companies have been known to place figurines on the test car’s hood and recite prayers. Anders just nods, collects his notes, and confidently walks to the elevated viewing area in the crash hall, above the runway’s entrance into it. 
This design cue continues even on the [rear of the car](https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/iyrmcqtolqbuxarcbto4.jpg).  Instead of a flat-ish rear, you can see at least 4 panels where well integrated angles are highlighting the curves/bends and reflecting light.
The [front](https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/pe13f0924rwit8xoynxu.jpg) is much of the [same](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZNr4odWra0E/VrmqnT7B2WI/AAAAAAAANzc/8lR4EJrTGzA/s1600/Volvo-S90-New-.jpg).  You have the ""[thor's hammer](http://jalopnik.com/the-2015-volvo-xc90-headlights-look-like-thors-hammer-1619995457)"" headlights and corporate grille and they've incorporated several bends and folks with the ideas of continuing to reflect different shades.  The hood is a nice example with the creases leading to almost concave sections which then lead to the edges where the ""shoulders"" begin to form.
In the [rear angle](https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/kjnzj3lnogkqlr1zkdlw.jpg) [shot](http://response.jp/imgs/feed_l/1014220.jpg
), you can see it all working [together](http://o.aolcdn.com/dims-shared/dims3/GLOB/crop/800x450+0+0/resize/800x450!/format/jpg/quality/85/http://o.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/8f82420f137a5ae8644cd64a402a9d2d/203379119/volvo-s90-wagon-spies2.jpg), with the shoulders providing the lighter reflections and darker areas on the top and below.
Lets move onto the interior.  
The interior is a perfect example of Swedish minimalistic design, while still putting function over form where safety is concerned.  
Lets start with the seats.  IMO, Volvo has been making the most comfortable car seats since the later 90s.  My [99](http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y1/xalwayswins/PICT0063.jpg) V70R had amazing leather/suede seats that are better than 97% of new car seats today.  My [05R](http://i.imgur.com/LYxjnFZ.jpg) wagon's seats are even better.  They're so good, I bought a pair online and turned them into office chairs.  More on that later.  Other than being [gorgeous](http://gcm.moniteurautomobile.be/clients/moniteur/content/medias/images/news/17000/400/30/2016-volvo-V90-12.jpg), the seats have the right blend of comfort and bolstering to keep you in place but not beat you up.  These seats are also supremely safe, with the WHIPS system incorporated to protect you from texting idiots, or just regular idiots:  
> A WHIPS equipped seat is designed so that the entire backrest helps to protect the front occupant's neck in a case of a rear impact. When the WHIPS system is deployed, the front seat backrests and headrests are lowered backward to change the seating position of the driver and front seat passenger. The main energy is absorbed via a pivot at the base of the seat – mechanism which allows the seat to move around the occupants actual hip joint while moving rearward to absorb additional energy. A piece of metal inside the backrest hinge deforms, absorbing more energy. The hinge piece needs to be replaced after having been deployed.
> According to Volvo's traffic accident research team, the WHIPS equipped seat resulted in a 33% reduction in short term injury and a 54% reduction in long term whiplash injuries caused by car accidents
> 
The interior also offers open pore wood which is a nice contrast to fake woods or overly lacquered woods found in most cars today.  It feels wonderful.  
The dash, glove box, navi, and controls all fit the design perfectly, with no large gaps or odd breaks from the design.  Notice how the glovebox door extends to the passenger door - the idea is to eliminate a seam and 1 source of rattle or flex a decade from now.  
Now look at the door speakers.  The grills have been incorporated into the trim for the handle, which then extends past the handle to serve as the visual line between the leather and wood portions.  Again, fewer seams make for a better look.
The frameless rearview mirror is a nice touch.
The dash appears to be 1 large piece, something manufacturers do when they care about current and future squeaks and rattles.  The dashes on my 99 and 05 wagons are the same way - even the defroster vents and covers are molded into the piece and can't be removed!  This adds a large expense, but really makes for a tighter car.
The [air vents](https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/qvebh0mwygvvai7wion5.jpg) are wonderfully incorporated into the design, with nice fading chrome trim.  You can also see the premium center channel speaker in this view.  Volvos can be equipped with wonderful stereos, but even the stock systems are excellent.
The [driver's view](https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/zscgvai3kaxqmyd5nc3z.jpg) is typical Volvo, with wheel buttons that are consistent from side to side and designed to make them easy to use without taking your eyes off of the road.  I believe these buttons scroll through the touchscreen menus so you do not have to move your hands from the wheel to cycle through the menus.  That 2 tone wheel is a great touch, especially since a 1 color creme wheel would look very dirty after awhile.
Overall, the interior is fantastic.  The XC90 interior has been called the best under $100k, and it is easy to see why.",2
"I won my class in NASA TX Time Trial this weekend and set a new track record. With pics and video.
So to follow up my last post about winning nationals I wanted to share what I did this last weekend. 
NASA Texas was at MSR Cresson a 1.7 Mile track southwest of Fort Worth. I went up there on Thursday night and practiced Friday (my 3rd day on track) and competed on Saturday and Sunday. 
On Saturday morning it POURED rain all night, so the track got pretty washed off leading to reduced grip. The track record was 1:15.7 and I had gone 15.9 on Friday. However that wasnt to be on the green track and in the last session I put on new ""stickers"" and went 16.0 to take the win for the day. 
Sunday was the better session for conditions and I put the good tires back on for the second session. I went out and did a 1:15.5 to break the record on my 5th lap of the session. I had one competitor still on track, but he had caught traffic and I wasn't worried about him beating that time and I assumed that I had won for the day. We were all back in the garage celebrating and someone walked up and checked if we had reviewed the times and it turns out that a Vette had gone 1:15.4 a few laps after I left!
This gave me two more sessions on a warming track to get a time in, first lap in the next session someone blew their diff and ended the session. This left me with just one more try to go faster then I ever had on tires that now had 3 heat cycles. Luckily there were less cars still around for the very last session and the air temp had even cooled down a little. So the conditions were good and I gave the now aging tires an extra lap to come up to temp before I really pushed and managed to eek out a 15.2 on my last lap of the day. My competition stayed out and did 12 laps at full pace, which is really crazy in a TT car with Hoosier A7s when his car weighs 3000 lbs and has 360? WHP. He managed a 15.7 on the last lap, but was not quite there. 
For reference there were about 40 cars in the TT group and the only car faster then me on this weekend was a 700 WHP fully prepped vette in the unlimited class. My time was also faster then the TT1 class record (6 lbs per horsepower class, mine is 8 lbs per horsepower). 
This was my first event running 245 tires in the rear, before I had been running 275 on a 9"" wheel (because rules) and this event I ran 245's on a 10"" because it let me drop 75 lbs (car now weights 1970 lbs with me in it). I also had splitter diffusers on the car and vented front wheel arches. I guess I need to vent the rears as well for my next project.

"My parents are awesome: my 18th birthday present
My dad used to race minis when he was younger. this is especially relevant given the fact that he's a 6'10 man (he fills a doorway.)
Naturally, as a result, I really wanted a mini as my first car, but an old one. My parents had me going about fixing up one we owned, which I was willing to do, just not quite able. Anyway, I woke up to this beauty: http://i.imgur.com/7N3Bn2p.jpg
My parents, as I said, are awesome. Now what's more awesome is the story of my dad getting it here. Due to living by the sea, he couldn't find one in this area that wasn't rusted. We have family inland and they looked around for one. This was all being done without my knowledge.
My dad had to fly up for business. This was good timing too, as my family had located two prospective minis. Apparently one was slightly better mechanically, but had some body issues, so my dad chose the one in the picture above.
Here's where it starts to get interesting. He decides to drive this thing down. Now, were this trip being done in his Merc, he could probably do it in about 9 hours, assuming he drove fast. For most people it'd be a two day trip. 
There are a few technical terms in this story I might screw up, sorry if I do, I'm no expert.
So he sets off and after about an hour or so the exhaust blows. There's no sound system in this car, so this resulted in a rather noisy and uncomfortable, at least for the ears, trip. However, this wasn't actually a problem mechanically, so he carried on.
Every town he stopped at he was getting offers for the car, I mean really, it's stunning. So probably about 1/3 of the way through the journey he gets to a stop and go for roadworks. He begins to gear down when he realizes that he only has 4th gear! Later it was found out that a pin was popped in the gearbox. 
We were lucky in that the mini has serious amounts of torque and my dad knows how to drive pretty well. As a a result, he could, with a bit of effort, start it and stop it in fourth. At this point he decided he wanted to get it as close to home as possible to lower the cost of towing, were it to break down, so he decides to keep driving, instead of stopping at half way as planned.
He estimated that he had just enough petrol that he didn't need to stop at the next town and could go onto the one after. Unfortunately he didn't factor in stop goes so at 1:15am he runs out of petrol in the middle of what's basically a desert. Luckily he phoned and got help to bring him some petrol, enough to get him to the next town to fill up again.
Great, you're thinking, now he just drove it home, right? Not quite. It then began to pour and minis and rain don't cope that wonderfully together. Fairly close to home, about 100km, the car dies. Luckily, with some manual effort of connecting wires that would probably just get me killed, he gets it started again and pulls it into the workshop where it's to be fixed up at about 5:30am, 18 and a half hours after he set off.
TL;DR My dad is awesome and drove a mini down as it encountered problems.

"So I just upgraded from my 2016 VW GTI...
(For the lazy, pics are in the middle and bottom of the post!)
So first a quick background about me: I’m a young Workers’ Compensation attorney and volunteer firefighter (will be 30 in January). My biggest passion has always been cars. My first car was [a 1990 Nissan Maxima SE 5-speed \(looked exactly like this\)](https://imgur.com/a/ZXyd0) that my dad had bought new around the time I was born, and I LOVED that car. Next I had [a 2003 TL Type-S](http://i.imgur.com/rfHaduo.jpg) that I also adored, and which I had bought off my dad after he initially leased it. My last 2 cars were both 6-speed manual VWs ([2013 GLI](https://i.imgur.com/Wumj0gX.jpg) and [2016 GTI](https://i.imgur.com/ItYMc86.jpg)), and I was more than ready to go for the ’19 Golf R this time now that my GTI’s lease was ending.
I had a few hesitations (such as paying such a high price for a VW, and the fact that you can’t get a Golf R in the USA with a sunroof, which is a huge deal to me as I use it all the time), but I was still willing to look past this because I loved the R.
Unfortunately, VW lost my business due tp their unwillingness to deal. They wanted MSRP for the car, and would give NO deals. They wanted a ton of money down and a ton of money per month, and I’m someone that always puts no money down in a lease. Further still, no VW dealership in my extended area could confirm (1) when I’d get the car, or (2) what the exact final monthly price would be. 
I was getting frustrated.
I decided to discuss my issues with my father (64yo dentist), who I always go to for advice. He’s a huge car guy himself, and is a big BMW lover. He has [a mint 1992 E30 convertible 5-speed with 50k miles](https://imgur.com/a/AOAoP), and his daily is [a beautiful 2010 535i xDrive with only 60k miles](https://imgur.com/a/yqgRw). I’ve always loved and wanted a BMW as well, but didn’t think I could fit one that I wanted in my budget.
After speaking with my father, it turned out he knew a good dealer in Connecticut (I’m from New York myself) who had sold my dad’s friend (a dentist who leases space in my dad’s dental office) a bunch of M cars over the years. I called him up and told him my issues, and it turned out I could get a deal where I could lease a 2018 340i xDrive M-Sport for basically the same price as VW wanted for the Golf R (even a couple bucks a month cheaper!!).
Now the issue was finding the right specific car…
The specific issue here was I am a exacting and anal retentive son-of-a-bitch. I wanted a very specific build set. I wanted either Estoril Blue  or Mineral Grey, but wasn’t exactly dying for the grey because my last 4 cars have been either white or grey. I also demanded a 6-speed manual (of which 2018 is the last year one can get the same), the M-Sport Package, Adaptive Suspension, Navigation, and blacked out trim pieces like the grille.
My dealer connect was only able to find a couple new cars in his database that met my criteria, and by a couple I mean 3. At first we thought we found a mineral grey with everything I wanted, but it turned out it was sold a day beforehand! Then we found an Estoril Blue one, but it didn’t have navigation which meant the iDrive screen was small as shit and looked goofy, and for my job I travel to hearings all over New York State and need a good built-in nav system. 
Finally, we found the one I ended up buying.
**Here is it: [My new 2018 340i xDrive M-Sport. Mineral Grey Metallic with Coral Red Dakota Leather interior.](https://imgur.com/a/u7UFiLd)**
All the features and specs I wanted. Even some extras like a front splitter that I didn’t necessarily want but think is awesome to have. The only feature it DIDN’T have that I wanted was the adaptive suspension.
Regarding the adaptive suspension, I’ve heard mixed things. On one hand many on the BMW forums say don’t get a 340i without it, but many reviewers such as Car & Driver, as well as the people I spoke with from BMW (the ones that I trust) admit that it’s a bit “wonky” and that it never feels “just right” regardless of setting.
After consideration, I obviously decided to go with the car even though it has the standard static suspension.
Holy shit am I glad I did.
It rides AMAZINGLY. The first thing I did with the car was take it down to Delaware this weekend for my cousin’s wedding. A beautiful 3.5-hour drive to get started on the break-in period and get used to the car.
The suspension is perfect. It balances sportiness, stiffness, softness, and tautness perfectly. It feels like BMW adjusted it just right. I’m so happy I didn’t turn the car down over a lack of adjustable suspension. It’s a BMW through and through handling-wise.
The engine. My God. After 6 years of the EA888 4-cylinder, I had forgotten what it was like to daily a 6-cylinder in regard to both power, smoothness, and sound. The power is endless and everywhere. It’s got 100 more horsepower and over 60 more lb ft of torque than my old GTI (320hp and 330lb ft, to be exact), and you can tell. BMW says 0-60 in 4.6 seconds, and while I’ve been going easy on the car due to the break-in period, I can believe it. The stock exhaust is also amazing. Beautifully tuned, and when you let off the gas you get the burbles and even a couple farts (especially in Spot and Spot+ Modes!!). Cold starts are heaven.
The interior is fucking sweet. I was worried the red leather would be too “much,” but it looks beautiful and really pops against the grey exterior in a way that makes me happy I didn’t go with Blue and got the more subtle and sleek grey, because the red leather adds that excitement/“pop” I was looking for. I also love the aluminum hexagon interior trim.
Finally, the transmission. I had to get a 6-speed. Had to get the last year of the 3-series that would offer a manual in the US (excluding M cars). I’m so happy I did. It’s smooth and precise, a joy to use, and it’s nice when you are in comfort mode and it rev-matches for you.
In all, I couldn’t be happier. This is a very big jump for me in terms of quality, power, and price for my daily driver, and even though I’ll have to continue to work my ass off as a lawyer day in and day out, knowing I get to go outside and get in this car every day after work makes it all worth it.
The next step is to get it tinted (20% all around, as always), and I think I’m also going to have them do the Xpell paint protection film on the front/hood/side-mirrors as well as I very well may buy this car back after the lease is all goes well.
Just wanted to share my happiness with everyone here, and to let you guys know that (at least in my opinion), the Ultimate Driving Machine is still alive as well.

"I got to drive the McLaren 650S today.
http://imgur.com/a/KP9ge
Long story short: a good client of mine, who owns a 12C as his daily driver, got me on a mailing list for McLaren.  A few weeks ago, I received an invitation to an extended test drive event in a new 650S.  
I pick the McLaren Orange beauty and I'm paired with a McLaren rep.  He starts us up and we head out.  He's asking me questions about my comfort level in performance cars and I tell him about my limited track experience.  He feels good enough with my driving capabilities that when we swap positions, he puts the car from ""Normal"" mode into ""Sport"" mode.  Firming up the suspension and the sharpening engine mapping, the car transforms from a comfortable grocery getter into a more capable street machine.
We get to a nice, straight road and he tells me to open it up.  The red light turns green and we're off.  
The twin-turbos kick in around 3,500 RPM and I actually get some wheel slippage around 50 MPH.  Two quick upshifts later, we're over 90 and I have to back off - we are on public roads after all.  The acceleration is remarkable.  And once the turbos kick in, it really hooks up.  It sucks you into the seat and the carbon ceramic breaks bring you to a halt remarkably fast.  
We turn off the straight onto a curvy, but rather bumpy road, and he puts it in ""Track"" mode.  Further stiffening the suspension and making the engine just that much quicker.  I'm asked not to push it because the traction control is toned down, but you can feel the car has changed.  A few flowing corners later, here comes a nice, open right-hander and he says: ""go for it"".  
I drop two gears and we're off.  A slight drift through the corner and the car just feels wonderfully controllable.  Back up near 80 before I have to back off again.  We switch the two knobs that control the suspension and engine back from ""Track"" into ""Normal"" and the car changes immediately.  40 MPH in 5th at 1,500 RPM, the car's ready to help me get my errands done.
We get back to the dealership and I'm giddy.  My rep is incredibly cool.  I tell him how much fun that was and he says he enjoyed our drive.  A manager comes up and we start small talking, just giving a quick recap where we admit never broke any laws nor did anything reckless *wink-wink*.  The manager walks off and my rep tells me they're doing an event in the spring down in Austin at COTA.  He's going to do what he can to get me on that list.  I know these events are for potential buyers and I tell him I am in NO WAY in a position to EVER buy a McLaren.  He says he knows, but it's fun for them to have people who love cars and know what they're doing behind the wheel.
Fingers crossed that I'll have another post for you guys in the next few months.",2
"Don't brag about never being on a tow truck...
https://i.imgur.com/njsFLew.jpg
At least it didn't break down. Got t-boned last night from a red light runner while going out to pick up dinner for my wife and I. I just got cleared to drive on Wednesday after my third neck surgery about a month ago. Fortunately I didn't get hurt at all, air bags didn't deploy. It was a 35mph zone so it wasn't a super hard hit. Really hoping it's not totaled. Also the vinyl wrap held up surprisingly well.
And yeah, I mentioned yesterday that my car had never been on a tow truck in the 5 years I've owned it.",2
"How did people buy the new Corvette?
I guess the title should be more like ""How did people evaluate the new Corvette before buying them?""
Sorry if this comes across as noisy rant, but I'm sincerely curious about the situation:
Today I went to a Chevy dealership, looking at the new Corvettes. I'm in the market for a new car, with the M3/4 as my baseline and I""m also considering the Jaguar F Type and 911S as well. At the high end of my budget I even entertained a used MP4-12C, which I drove at a McLaren dealership near my place not too long ago.
I've heard nothing but good things about the new gen Corvette so I was going to give it a test drive, even though this would be my first time considering an American car.
What happened next was a displeasure to me. The salesperson at first welcomed me warmly, and then I mentioned I was interested in the C7, with a test drive wanted. He immediately cracked up and told me that nobody is allowed to test drive Corvettes (and he looked at me as if I just asked to put my name on his will), anywhere in the nation. Then he tried to lecture me about how if you are buying a $70k car you wouldn't want any miles on it. 
I immediately protested about how I was able to test drive cars more than 3x that price and he shot back at me about how limited production the Corvette is when compared to something like a MP4-12C(I shit you not), and everyone who buys the car knows EXACTLY what they are getting themselves into. He then told me everything about the car's heritage and how everyone who buys it are already ex-Corvette owners.
Now I've had the exact same thing happening to me before at another Chevy dealership last fall. At this point it got me pondering: What kind of people are buying the new Corvette? I buy cars for how they drive, whether it's a $20k Civic or a $150k R8, I ain't signing anything without at least getting a feeling about the car. So either all the new Corvettes are sold to the biggest circle-jerk of blind followers of them all, or I just had some very bizarre experience with the dealership. 
Is there a cult that I've to join by signing ""My descendants and I will always be buying Corvettes"" to get Chevy to send me a test vehicle or something? Why does this sound like Ferrari's preferred customer program???
I understand if we are talking about a P1 or a LaFerrari or something, but come on, it's a car that's cheaper than the M4 and will soon flood the used market in a few years. 
So the question is: if I want to buy a new Corvette, is my only option to blindly trust Chevy's marketing and put down $70k and gratefully drink the Koolaid? How is Chevy expected to expand their customer base? I'm extremely frustrated since as an auto enthusiast,  I genuinely want to consider what may be the best performance/cost sports car in the world but I am not a middle aged white guy who grew up with Corvettes in the family.
EDIT: For the people who tell me that I should trust professional reviews, the thing is that I don't. The reason is that many professional reviews of sports car push the car to its limit on the track and talk about how amazing it is to put power down while exiting the corner at 120mph. For example the 2009 GT-R got rave reviews from auto journalists but it drove like a reluctant and overweight bear on regular off-highway streets, the suspension and transmission was absolutely painful, even though all the journalists praised how practical the GT-R was because it has real backseats and a useful trunk. 
Nor do I possess the driving skills of professional reviewers and I may very well have a different take on the car even at tracks.
I don't even have problem with paying a premium for it if I really like it. But I feel like I'm not respecting myself nor am I respecting the engineers who put their hearts into making the car if I'm simply buying the car as a status symbol, not as a driving machine.
From their perspective, I don't think losing my sale hurts them, since they will still sell every Corvette that goes through there. But in the long run for Chevy, they just made me never willing to buy a Chevy in my life. They built a halo car for a reason. But for some reason it's easier for me to become a Ferrari customer than a Chevy one.
If Chevy wants to break the stereotype that Corvettes is ""fast cars in a straight line bought by rich rednecks suffering through mid-life crisis"", then they GOTTA make it a bit more approachable. I know they are trying to break that stereotype since the new Corvettes are very, very sophisticated, at least on paper.
McLaren can afford test drives because the factory supplies demo units to their dealerships, I don't see why Chevy can't do the same?
EDIT 2: I forgot to mention that last fall I experienced something very, very similar at another Chevy dealership nearby, the guy was even ruder that time. I just thought maybe the car is too new and didn't let it bother me too much. By now two of the biggest Chevy dealership in Bay Area have treated me the same way.",2
"Unpopular opinion: The only reason the A80 Supra is so popular is because of the Fast and Furious and the aftermarket, not because it was a good car.
Sorry for more Supra spam, but I'm interested to see if anyone agrees or if I'm completely deluded.
When asking yourself what made the A80 so great and popular, immediately you think of the 2JZGTE and the orange Supra Paul Walker drove in F&F. Everyone remembers *that* orange sports car from F&F, car enthusiast or not.
You don't think of it's great handling characteristics, or rich racing pedigree, because it had neither of those two. The A80/ 2JZGTE sucked that bad in Motorsports Toyota actually had to resort to using a Celica engine to try keep up with the far superior GTR at the time, to which it couldn't and was eventually retired from Motorsport all together.
The 2JZGTE is only considered a great engine because of the aftermarket. It was the aftermarket who realized the drivetrains great potential for making good reliable power. I'm not taking anything away from Toyota because they make brilliant engines, but so do BMW. 
Toyota was never going to spend so much time and money engineering an entirely new straight 6, when majority of Earth's population don't care about cars anymore. For every 10 people who want a ""3JZ"", there are a 1000 who don't care and just want to drive to work and back reliably. 
Hell, even the Japanese people don't care anymore as 95% of them use public transportation and the remaining 5% drive eco cars. So what was the best option? Go to a proven brilliant straight 6 manufacturer; BMW.
The main critisism of the A90 is it uses a BMW drivetrain, when on paper it makes the same power as the 2JZGTE did anyway. The closed deck B58 will prove just as reliable as the 2JZGTE. Add in that the chassis was engineered by Tetsuya Tada, the same guy who engineered the GT86, you've got an absolutely brilliant car. The interior is also done by BMW, one of the best interior manufacturers out there. There is absolutely no way Toyota would of been able to match BMWs interior quality...
In every single way the A90 is absolutely a better car than the A80: fact.
When you break it down and think about it, the A80 really isn't that great of a car. It's so hyped up but why? I just don't understand it. I see shit about the A90 not living up to the Supra name, how? The A80 and A90 are almost identical, what more do people want? 
TLDR; A80 and A90 are essentially the same car, but the A90 has 20 years of technological advancement and is without doubt a better car and does the Supra name justice.",2
"Black Cats Unite: stray kitten crossed traffic and hid in the undercarriage of my F-Type for over an hour. Police, bystanders, and playing cat videos on YT involved in rescue efforts.
The story - 8am Sunday. Leaving GF's place to go to a Cars and Coffee in central CT. As I was pulling out onto a fairly busy road (rt. 44), I saw her running across a perpendicular side street. I put my hazards on, pulled over, and opened the door. She was already running toward the car, so I was hopeful she'd jump right in. No. 
[She ran under the car instead.](https://youtu.be/jldyrfXOB_o)  
I tried to coax her out around towards the passenger side, but [she decided that climbing up the front passenger side control arm was a better idea.](https://imgur.com/a/SFNqC7e)   
It was obvious that it was not going to be a quick stop, so I called local PD, and just kind of tried to keep listening to figure out exactly where she was. She was meowing loudly at least, so her general location was known.  [Trying to use my phone to find her exact location was not working.](https://youtu.be/ECNpYQf8H-k)
[PD shows up](https://i.imgur.com/NrY6Ge1.jpg) and a bunch of bystanders have started to help at this point. She's come down a few times, only to scamper over to the driver's side and climb back up the control arm on that side. One of the guys helping out, almost reached her tail, but she jumped into the barrel of the wheel, and ran to the back of the car. Up the control arm again, and now she's really up there. We can barely hear her. 
After about 45 minutes, the cop is like ""Well, there's nothing else we can do. Maybe just park it and she'll come out eventually.""  It's starting to get busy and it's a terrible place to be pulled over, so I get it.  I tell him my GF's place is right around the corner and ask if he can follow me. I planned on limping there, as the thought of a kitten falling into a part of a running drive train isn't pleasant, obviously. There's also a pretty hot exhaust, falling out into the road, etc etc. 
I limp the car back and can hear her the whole way, which was good. I pulled into and open spot and the cop took off. It was better now at least, as it was safe from traffic and on flat ground. At this point, she got quiet. She was super small, so I knew she couldn't really ninja cat away without me seeing, like a full sized cat could. I figured she went to sleep, because cat. I was about to just leave the car, call a buddy and head to C&C, hoping she would get bored and come out eventually. I didn't want to jack the car up, as lowering it back down could crush her, and there's not a lot to reach under there anyway. Again, I didn't want her squeezing up into an even tighter spot where she couldn't get her self out. 
There was literally nothing I thought I could do. A few people were out walking their dogs, and I explained what happened. I figured maybe someone had some treats or something. I know nothing about cats. 
One very nice woman, who was walking a handsome hound-type dog named Duke, had a good idea: maybe she would respond to sounds of another cat. I looked up ""mother cat calling kittens"" on YoutTube, and played [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l81-68Cwr0c) on my phone for like 20 minutes.  
She actually came down out of the car...lol. So she's under there, out of reach, looking at the phone, then back at me like ""I see what you're trying to do, asshole."" But, as often happens, curiosity got the better of the kitten. I moved the phone out further away from the car and backed off, myself. By this time, the woman, had returned from bringing Duke back inside, and saw the little kitten cautiously approaching the phone. I figured the best play would be to get behind her, so if she made a break for it, she'd go away from the car and not back under it. Sure enough, she made a move towards some bushes and we had her surrounded. The woman was able to finally get a hold of her and she calmed down pretty quickly.
[Package secured](https://i.imgur.com/D2Aw6aL.jpg)
The woman took her inside, fed her and gave her water. She then took the kitten to the vet.  According to the vet, she's about 6 weeks old and healthy. The woman is a cat owner/animal lover, and is adopting her. So, in the end, it all ended well.  Oh, and I made it to Cars and Coffee. 
TL;DR Stray kitten crossed traffic to hide under and in my car for over an hour. Played cat videos to lure her out. She's fine, adopted by a wonderful person and I made it to Cars and Coffee.

"Picked up my first brand-new car on Friday night... Tangerine Scream Focus ST!
I've been DDing old BMWs since my senior year of college, and had a '95 Miata track/weekend toy as well. I got tired of owning two 17-year-old cars right around the time the Miata started burning more oil than I could pour into it.
Last year, at the DC Auto Show, I sat in a yellow Focus ST that was apparently coming to the U.S. ""soon."" The Recaro seats were incredible, the paint color was too cool, and I quickly put the thought out of my head because ""oh, I could never afford that.""
Well, the Miata picked up its drinking habit, the E36 was very solid but kept me always worried about ""what will break next from age,"" and I decided to look around at newer cars to daily-drive.
After crunching numbers and doing some test drives, it turned out that the ST was actually attainable. I picked up a TON of side gigs, saved ferociously, and got a pretty large down payment together. 
The car was ordered on November 12th, built on December 19th, and I picked it up this past Friday evening. To say I'm excited is an understatement. It's just a fantastic little car.

"What It Cost To Supercharge an S2000 [Xpost from r/s2000]
One week from today my AP2 will be going under the knife and no longer will it be naturally aspirated. Many people want to know how they can get more power out of an s2000, and often comments say “why not buy a supercharger?” So to give a better idea on the entire process I will be giving some information about my experience. 
First about my s2000. I have had my 07 Ap2(my first s2000) for about 2 years now. I purchased it of an old lady who more than likely never hit Vtec once. I purchased it with just over 90,000 miles and have put on about 20,000 miles. Some may say that is too high of mileage to think about putting boost to an engine but the compression test showed really good numbers and the car runs like new. So I decided what the hell, if I blow a motor so be it. I want to kill this car (eventually) and rebuild it from the ashes any way so might as well finally have a “fast” car.
Through preliminary research I saw a few brands of super charger thrown around. Science of Speed, Comptec, and Kraftwerks being the predominant ones. Weighing the options I decided to go with Kraftwerks. So this write up will consist of my experience with this brand, but the experience can be similar to the others. 
Many people say “$3000.00 gets you a supercharger” well it can get you close but there is so much more that needs to be bought. So here is my parts break down and cost, these are the exact prices that I had paid so some items may have changed in cost. Also I will include where I purchased the items from also the [item number].
Kraftwerks s2000 supercharger kit [150-05-2001]: $3,700.46 from Amazon
Kraftwerks s2000 Belt and pulley revision kit [150-05-9302]: $342.39 from Group-A Engineering. 
ACT pressure plate/ OEM clutch kit [NA]: $699.99 from Moddiction
4 Bar Map Sensor [MAP-B-4BR]: $93.75 from Amazon
Total $ 4836.59
These items I consider 100% necessary. The revision pulley kit was purchased because the kit that I have was old (from 2014) and wasn’t the last revision, it was an option that I got regardless. The KW kit that I purchased is the one that comes with Hondata Flashpro. Also I would like to note that there are many options with 4 bar maps (the new kits come with them) and if I had to choose one now I would get the Skunk 2.
I also bought these items. Some are considered necessary, some just personal preference.
2 gauge A-pillar pod [22443]: $68.95 from Moddiction
AEM Wideband o2 sensor [30-4110]: $172.52 from Amazon
Boost gauge [SP0F000050]: $18.97 from Moddiction
Berk high flow cat [BT1602-HFC-MET]: $244.39 from Moddiction
Urea Grease [08798-9002]: $14.09 from Amazon
Also Upgraded brakes centric rotors and hawk pads for: $310.07 from Amazon
Tax Paid: $308.46 
Grand total: $5974.04
I am not including tools that I have purchased, or the cost for tuning. But this gives an idea of what things cost. I will be doing a write up about my experience with installation as I will be doing it in a week, including the clutch install and the tuning (if it’s possible). ",2
"With the recent Demuro video, I thought I'd share my dad's 1981 Fiat Spider.
Photos first: https://imgur.com/a/Y135Z
I rarely see any posts of Fiats here on /r/cars, so I thought I would share with you guys my father’s 1981 Fiat Spider 2000 Pininfarina 50th Anniversary Edition; the epitome of all known Fiat stereotypes, especially the infamous “Fix It Again Tony” phrase. My dad purchased this directly off a Fiat showroom floor in 1981 in Miami after cross shopping other typical 80s sports cars, including a Datsun 280zx. Before he even got it home, the car had issues; the top leaked and one of the power windows wasn’t working properly. Much to my grandfather’s dismay, he kept the car and thoroughly thrashed it for the next 10 some ought years until the birth of my sister. He took it on numerous trips down to Key West with my mother, whom he married just five years later (yes, the car has been in his life longer than 30+ years of marriage with my mom), a saltwater fish tank breaking in the backseat, and even cramming four grown adults into the car. Flash forward to 2010, my dad and I towed the car nearly 800 miles to Asheville, N.C., where we participated in the 2010 Fiat Freakout and drove a large portion of the Tail of the Dragon. 
	
After my sister and I came around, the car wasn’t driven, or abused, as much as he would’ve liked, but nevertheless the car was garage kept throughout its entire life. I would say in the past 13 years or so, he began restoring it back to its original glory, which included sorting out some of the problems it carried over from the factory in Italy. 
	
Now, the backstory out of the way, we can get to the good stuff. The car commemorates Pininfarina’s 50th anniversary of sales in America, which prompted Fiat to create 1,000 champagne gold cars worldwide, each with an assortment of features that distinguished them from the other thousands of spiders sold. Aside from the paint, the car came equipped with power windows, identifiable Pininfarina badging (visible near the door panel) with a number ranging from 1-1,000, a brown steering wheel and other minor features.  As she sits, the car has over 168,000 miles, all put on by my father and even more shockingly, all on the original clutch which is cable driven. The car has been painted about three different times, one of which she was keyed the day after she got out of the booth. The car has a few performance upgrades, including headers, an Ansa exhaust, stiffer springs and an upgraded starter and alternator. The car has Wilwood four piston calipers in the front, which he installed after having little to no working breaks for roughly 10 years. After squaring away the performance issues, of which there were many (to this day she has a slight oil leak to which even our mechanic cannot locate the origin), he began working on restoring the interior/exterior. 
	
He has had the iconic Cromodora wheels reshaped and restored to their original glory. The front and rear seats, as well as the door panels were recently reupholstered from leather he sourced from a wholesale shop in Austria. The top (not pictured) was just redone as well as the entire carpet. He is getting to the point where the car is complete enough where he can still take it out on the weekends and ride the hell out of it without worrying about being stranded on the side of the road as it used to do when he was dating my mom all those years ago. While the car used to fit the stereotype of “Fix It Again Tony,” she has gotten a bit more placid in her older age and doesn’t surprise my dad as much as she used to (knocks on wood). Is it fast? No, not really. But she has enough get up to put a smile on your face and handles like it’s on rails. I look forward to the day the car is bequeathed to me and I can continue to romp the hell out of her and scare people with her very Italian sounding horn. Feel free to ask any questions about her or her history.

"After years of searching, I have finally found (and own) my very own!!
Hi r/cars!!
I’m excited to share I’ve been fortunate enough to find another unicorn (I say this in the loosest of terms) on my list and have to share.  
So, I have this goal (that more than one person has told me is ridiculous) of obtaining ten (10) collector cars.  I have put a lot of thought and planning into this goal with a roadmap of sorts… a budget, with milestones to meet this goal.  On this budget, I have even narrowed down to the year I will be able to purchase the next car on the list.  ((Five down, five to go)), but of the ten on this list, two of these cars are so obscure/unique/rare, I have them listed as “buy “if/when” found”…
[I shared with you two years ago when I found the first of these two, and I was really surprised how well received it was.](https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/49a7uh/after_more_than_10_years_of_searching_i_have/)
Well, Reddit… after 8-10 years searching for [one, I have finally found one.](https://imgur.com/a/lJ1Am)
A 1972 VAZ-2101  Zhiguli.  The export models were sold under the name of Lada, and they are commonly referred to as Kopeka (penny).  
This is a rare car to see on the roads here in the Midwest (U.S.A.).  In other parts of the world, they are a dime a dozen, or, a penny a dozen in FSU  ;-)  
This particular car came from Kharkov, Ukraine.  It took about (3) months to have it imported.  Was a (1) owner car prior to my purchase.  The previous owner was a engineer who kept meticulous records.  ((His journal is entertaining to read.))   It arrived with just under 23k kilometers ((NOT 123k)) (14,202 miles) when it arrived.   ((The tires were so old, the sidewalls were stamped “Made in USSR”  First thing I did was put new tires on it, then discovered they had tubes in them)) 
So far, I’ve put a few hundred miles on it since receiving it in late December, but for the most part its been cooped up waiting for spring to arrive.  I can’t wait for the weather to break so I can finally give it a complete detail after it’s long journey.
It may not be the most luxurious car there, but I can guarantee you it will be making its round at the local car meets such as Sud's and Cars & Coffee.
Anyhow, if you’ve made it this far, thanks for allowing me to share.  If anyone is to understand this addiction, I’m sure it will be the people of r/cars. ",2
"It's not as nice as a lot of cars here, but I bought my first ""fun"" car
TL;DR I bought a ['17 Focus ST3](https://imgur.com/a/r7lQcbE) instead of a GTI and couldn't be happier
I've always wanted a fun car but was never able get one either because I was broke or had other priorities that came first. So instead I bought a ['14 Focus SE Sport](https://imgur.com/a/2iQWh8C) in early 2014 and put 86k miles on it over the 5 years I had it. It was a great car (completely bullet proof, the only issues I had were because of me) and my first manual car. Some time last year I started putting $300-500 away per month for a new car and in April of this year I started getting serious about a replacement.
I knew that my next car would have to reliable but fun and so I was going to be picky. I made a list of what the car had to be and what options came in it. It needed to be comfortable as a daily driver while also able to haul people and cargo. It also needed to be a manual, have decent horsepower, and preferably forced induction. A truck was out of the question, I had already owned one and have no interest in owning another for a while. The only ""performance"" sedans that are also affordable (Fusion Sport, G8, etc.) either weren't offered in manuals or had been out of production for too long so I couldn't find a low mileage example. So I was left with getting another hatchback (which I was fine with since I had come to love my Focus hatch). North America has quite a few hot hatches that won't break the bank so I made a list of the ones I was interested in. I settled on four: Mazda Speed3, GTI, Focus ST, and Fiesta ST. I briefly considered the Veloster N but the fact it was only offered as a 3 door (or is it a 3.5 door?) turned me off from it. The Speed3 was the next one to be crossed off as I searched high and low for a low mileage one and couldn't find anything less than ~120k miles. Next to go was the Fiesta ST. As much as I liked the idea of the FiST, it was just too small for me since my wife and I will be starting a family in the next couple years. So this left me with the recently discontinued Focus ST and the tried and true GTI. I was leaning more towards the ST because I could get a lot more for my money compared to the GTI but I tried to keep an open mind.
Then one weekend I did another search for STs and GTIs when I stumbled across a 2017 Focus ST with the ST3 package that was located about 4.5 hours away. I was immediately intrigued since it only had 19k miles on it and the previous owner ordered it with every option except the premium wheels. It's got the full leather Recaro seats, heated steering wheel, heated seats, heated side mirrors, moon roof, 10 speaker Sony sound system, HID headlights with cornering lights, Sync3 with the 8in touchscreen, and the carbon fiber trim package. I called the dealer the following Monday to see how willing they were to make a deal. I told them that they'd have to work with me because there was no way I was coming out to them unless I knew I was going to buy it. So after talking and haggling we were finally able to come to an agreement. I agreed to their asking price of $19,900 and they agreed to give me $5,500 for my trade in (I put down another $4,500 so I only financed $13,600 after ad valorem, taxes, and a 6yr warranty). So I made a deposit and my wife and I drove up the following weekend to Tennessee. I brought it home and have put 2,500 miles on it over the past month. This thing is just pure fun. It's got enough power for me (252hp/270 torque @ 93) and is an absolute blast on twistys. But part of me wasn't sure I made the right decision since I never test drove a GTI. That was until my friend bought a '17 GTI with the PP2. After driving his I'm so happy I went with the ST. The GTI's clutch is way too light and numb for my tastes and you could definitely feel the power difference. Plus, the rubbery golf ball shift knob felt laughably cheap compared to the stock ST knob and even more so compared to the CF knob that mine is equipped with. The price difference between the two sealed the deal in my opinion. His GTI was listed at $22k but lacked all of the comparable options save for the HID headlights and heated seats. His also came with Golf R brakes which is pretty nice but didn't offset the rest.",2
"Someone stole my car today and I'm grieving as if I lost a friend.
Thought about posting this to offmychest, but I think I'm more likely to find people who ""get it"" here.
I had a 1996 Oldsmobile Ciera Cutlass. She was old; I knew she was bound to break down one way or another. But I didn't expect her to be stolen right out from under me, while I was at work, no less. After I frantically scrambled to see if she'd been towed and filed the police report, I just sat down and cried. 
I paid cash out of pocket for her at 15 and put well over 100,000 miles on her (on top of the 183,000 she already had!). I'd found her some good mechanics and spent time learning how to do basic repairs and body detailing myself. That car took me all over the US, moved with me to my new home, and took me away from horrible situations more than once. Truly a reliable, wonderful car. 
I honestly feel like I've lost a dear friend. The grief is more intense than I would have expected. I can always get a different car--it's been 7 years, some could probably argue that it was time anyway. It's just that I know that car as well as myself and it's painful. 
Has anyone else dealt with grief from losing a car before?",2
"I flew to Ohio, drove to Indiana, bought a car and drove it back to Washington DC, all in 14 hours. Now it's home and it's wonderful.

After my E36 convertible was totaled thanks to hydrolock in the Outer Banks, I took a look at the state of my automotive union and realized I needed to do some test drives to figure out what I really wanted next.
There was talk of buying nothing. I live in Northern Virginia, a few miles from DC, and just moved walking distance to a Metro station. In theory I could Metro to work and drive my truck when I need wheels. That thought lasted about four days, as I decided shoving my face in a stranger's armpit is a less than pleasant way to commute home every afternoon.
Driving my F150 daily was tough - it averages 13 MPG in city driving and is big enough that parking in NoVA and DC is a hassle. So, I did need (and want) another ""daily.""
I talked to a lot of friends about potential options and got out on some test drives - considering models I had previously dismissed, some of which were pretty entertaining in their own right.
After driving some stuff and thinking 'bout some stuff, I ultimately realized that another BMW is what I wanted. My first thought was a 330ci, figuring it'd be a repeat of the white 'vert... cheap, easy to own, reliable, etc. Of course, I test drove one and it was exactly that... aka, boring. It made me sad to drive because it drove like the E36, but with less of the ""cool factor"" that a 20-year-old BMW with cracked bumper and bent BBS's can only have.
On the way home from that 330ci test drive, I realized that shit, I'm 27 and have wanted an E46 M3 for a while now, I'm financially in a position to buy one, and the cars aren't getting much cheaper nor am I getting any younger so fuck it, that's what I'm buying next.
I decided on only blue paint, really didn't want a gray interior, refused to buy an SMG, and preferred a convertible but would have considered a coupe with sunroof. Test drove a few locally and started putting feelers out on forums. I figured a drive to get the car would be ""easy enough"" so long as I didn't fly to California.
**The probably stolen Mystic Blue one**
I found a Mystic Blue on Cinnamon 'vert in Brooklyn and called the seller about it. I was supposed to go up last Monday to buy it, but he completely ghosted me after we made all plans. The car had smoked taillights, awful wheels and North Carolina tags on it, and the seller really didn't want to accept a cashier's check (""Cash only man, I don't trust banks"") so while I was sad for the missed opportunity of bright blue paint, I was not sad to miss a day trip of traveling to Brooklyn to be mugged.
**The one I bought**
The seller found me on E46Fanatics and said he had a Carbon Black/Cinnamon convertible (6MT) and an Imola/Black coupe (SMG). Obviously, dibs on the 'vert. 
A good friend and I had been discussing all of these potential purchases (while trying to keep a secret from the rest of our friends, all of which were nagging us both to find out what I wanted) and both thought this one was a good candidate to become mine. The only caveat was that it was in Richmond.
Richmond, Indiana. Which is a lot farther from home than Richmond, Virginia.
Some quick math at work revealed we could fly out and drive the car home in one day if we timed everything right. So, I started talking to the seller and asked what he was doing on Saturday, October 15th. And I bought some plane tickets.
**The Purchase**
Buying one-way plane tickets for a Saturday flight on a Wednesday means you're at the mercy of the airline as to the price you'd pay. Each ticket was going to be $355  :shock: which made the trip kinda not worth it. Thankfully, I had some leftover points on a credit card and got our two tickets for the sum of $11 in tax. Trip is now worth it.
We each took an Uber from our homes to DCA and met in the lobby at 7 AM on Saturday, for an 8:15 AM flight to Dayton, Ohio. After a breeze through the strip-down-lift-your-arms-turn-and-cough TSA line, my friend grabbed an OJ and I found some coffee. We boarded a German-made bus that took us to the Miata of airplanes, operated by Air Wisconsin, *don'tchaknow*.
Our flight was easy... only 18 passengers meant everyone got their own row to stretch out. The flight lasted maybe an hour. We were at the airport's Starbucks enjoying another drink 10 minutes before our scheduled landing time.
I texted the seller, and told him to meet us in front of the airport... which is small enough to have the parking structure across from the terminal. My friend noticed the Avis sign hanging in a window and I mused about what I could rent for $39 a day if this M3 sucked and we had to get home.
The seller pulled up with his girlfriend behind him in a white Ford Escape. He hopped in with her and gave the two of us the M3 so we could test drive as we followed them to his bank, back in Richmond, IN - about a 45 minute drive due west. We made it to the bank with nearly an hour to spare before they closed at noon. The car was as represented, so I bought it!
The seller took us back to his place, two blocks away, to get the rest of the paperwork and a few spare parts for the car. My goal was to be on the road by noon, and at 11:50 we pulled away from his house, with my address entered into the car's navigation system and Waze on our phones.
**The Drive Home**
We stopped to fill the tank before leaving Indiana, with our sights set on Columbus, Ohio for lunch at Chipotle. We did this first leg of the drive with the top down, and figured after the novelty of the convertible wore off and the food comas set in, we'd do the rest of the drive with it up. Less wind noise and buffeting = more energy for the drive.
After Chipotle, my friend took the wheel and pointed the car east on I-70. Traffic was light all day and speed limits were 70 mph for the most part, which meant we could make some serious time. I fiddled with the crappy FM transmitter I bought for this trip (the car only supports FM and CDs stock) and took some photos. Both of us had the idea of ""just get home"" versus trying to meander and sightsee, so our only pit stop was in Morgantown, West Virginia to refuel and change drivers. 
The stop at the Sheetz in Morgantown was brief, just enough time to refuel, clean the windshield, and grab some energy drinks before I hopped in the driver's seat and we pressed on. 
Semi-trucks were blowing our doors off when we were doing 75-80, minivans were hustling at 85, so we uh, kept up. :thumbup: Miles kept ticking by and the car was a peach, very happy to just sit there at whatever speed all day long.
Waze and the car had both estimated an 8:15 PM arrival at my friend's house, and we pulled into his driveway at 8:18. Right on. Snapped a few photos of my new car with his E36 M3 and I headed for home, top back down and seat heater on high.
I made it home right around 9:00 - put the roof up, took one final photo and walked up the stairs for some leftovers and a cold beer, shaking my head in disbelief that I was back home after being in Indiana the same day.
It would have been a crappy trip to take alone but going with a friend made it a lot of fun. Counting the Uber rides and flight, we covered over 1,000 miles and six states in roughly 14 hours. Pretty crazy. The whole trip felt very Top Gear esque and I wholeheartedly recommend everyone else do this once in their lives (at least). Great experience.
**The car, tell me about that**
* 2006 BMW M3
* Carbon Black over Cinnamon
* 6MT
* 126,500 miles as of parking it last night
* E92 M3 (?) 19"" wheels with newish tires
* Xenons, heated seats, park distance control, headlight washers, Harman/Kardon audio
* Eibach lowering springs
* Feels like some sort of short shifter
* Warranty for the next year or 12k miles (seller bought a 4-year warranty when he bought the car and it can transfer to me)
I'm swapping out the black kidneys for chrome thanks to a friend who wants to trade - I prefer the more contrasty look of chrome against the navy blue paint. The steering wheel has some heavy wear at the top so, so I'm buying a minty-clean replacement from a racecar build. The driver's seat bolster has a small tear, as they all do. The passenger seat has a tear from a knife when the car was broken into about six months ago. We've found a leather repair kit that will fix it easily.
Other than those couple of cosmetic things, it's in really good shape and drives very well. The PO hit a semi truck chunk of tire on the highway and had to have the bumper, radiator, foglights and engine fan replaced. He took it to EAG for that work. All other maintenance has been done at the local BMW dealership. 
Pretty pumped about this new ""daily beater"" of mine... I'm sure she'll see some pace car laps at VIR, Dominion Raceway, and Summit Point, as well as some autocrosses to break up the monotony of being a strict commuter!",2

"4 years, 3 shops and 30k+ later. My 600+ awhp evo is finished.
Original thread:
https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/2acemo/my_soon_to_be_700whp_evo/  
So, this might be a long story. I know how you all like stories. This tale is about chasing the built car dream. I have always wanted to get my car into Super Street when I was younger. I carefully researched parts, shops and allocated time and money. From what should have been a simple built motor turned into a 4 year long paperweight money pit. I have spent so much money over the last 4 years; sometimes you are probably better off quitting.   
Year 1:  
  
I took the car to a south bay area shop for an engine build. It took them a while to pull out the engine, as I was probably on the bottom of the schedule and what not. I believe it was around 3 months or so. After they had pulled it out, they went ahead and sent my head to a race shop called Comptech in Sacramento. I believe they used a local machine shop for the short block but decided to assemble the long block once the short block got back. After waiting a whole year, I saw zero progress. By this time, I was wondering what the hold was up. The shop told me that my head wasn’t finished. I ended up calling Comptech myself to see why my head wasn't done yet and they stated they were missing parts and could not finish the headwork. I ended up calling the south bay shop and had them sorted out. The shop stated they had sent the parts over 6 months ago to Comptech but Comptech stated they had not received anything. I went back to the south bay shop and they promptly sent the parts out.  
  
Amazingly, the headwork was finished within a weeks after they got the parts. I even drove 3 hours to Comptech myself to pick up the head to make sure that it was finished and brought it back to the south bay shop in a timely manner. After I dropped off the head, they started to assemble the long block together. They forgot to give the balance shaft delete to the machine shop to install it. They decided to install the bearing and balance shaft delete themselves.

First startup with old turbo:  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaeBn1XOUa0  
  
After the assembly was finished, we did the first startup and put it on a lift to check everything. This is where we ran into a claimed smoking turbo issue. The shop stated that the turbo from Precision Turbo and Engine could have been damaged or just broken. This was a brand new turbo. We ran through different scenarios to find out why the turbo was smoking but we never figured it out. I called PTE to find out and they said the drain fitting for the turbo was too sharp of an angle and it was pushing oil through the seals. The shop told me they tested different fittings out and it didn’t fix the problem. I ended up selling the turbo and buying another one from the shop per their advice to get the car going. The person I sold the turbo to stated they had 0 problems with oil being pressed through the seals or smoking issues. (I only found out a few months after the buyer had bought it.) So, basically I bought another turbo on trust and recommendation. Not sure if new fittings were even tried.  
  
After everything was put together. It's tuning time. This part took a bit longer as the shop was getting a dyno installed and I ended up just trying to get the car street tuned. The car kept knocking for unknown reasons. I decided to pull off the valve cover myself. It turned out that the dual springs and retainers were not installed correctly. Only the larger spring were installed while the smaller helper springs were not. With this in mind, the cams were too aggressive for just the single spring and it ended up bending a valve. The shop proceeded to pull off the head and fix it. After this, it took about another month or two before they reinstalled everything after the fix.   
  
By this time was all done, the dyno was setup. We put the car on the dyno and it keeps knocking and we start to remove parts and replace parts hoping to find the knock. They had me removed the solid mounts, tape up piping because it could be rubbing and creating false knock. The car only knocks under load of this all happens over the next 2-3 months of problem solving and guessing. After this point there is little progress on the car and it sat for a bit.  
  
I continue to ask the tuner for an update but his response was the shop was not helping him out on the labor portion. I get tired of waiting for something that happen. I left the car there for the tune but it turned into this super long process. I provided everything and was just waiting for results. I was paying off my balance monthly as there was no indication that I was supposed to pay it all off at once and we would handle the bill at the end. While waiting and asking questions on why at this point it was taking so long, I was told that I tried to change too many parts at once and it makes it hard to diagnose the problem. I figured changing everything to something new would be easy but I guess not. I ended up just parting ways and taking my car back since I didn’t feel like they could have finished the build in a timely manner.   
  
Year 2 - Year 3:  
  
I spent some time figuring out what I want to do with the car from here. Do I just part out the car, sell everything, and get some money back or attempt to finish the build and throw more money into the pit. After talking with a few close friends and family, I concluded I would regret it if I did not see this through so I decided to finish the build.  
  
I then pay to have the car transported 8 hours to Southern California to another shop that was supposed to be reputable. It was there to be looked over, diagnose the problem and then get tuned. What ended up happening was it took about 3 months to finally get tuned since they were backed up. Then after attempts of tuning it, there turned out to be oil pressure issue. At this point, it was recommended by the shop to stop and then try to figure out the problem. After some back and forth talk, we agree the motor needs to be pulled inspected and rebuilt. From here, the car sat another 13 months of no progress. Empty promises that the car would be done and it would get started or it was on the schedule next week. The thing with social media sure shows everything they have done. I was told my car got pushed back because of SEMA cars or Shift Sector cars. Funny how the GTR's and Porsches get knocked out quick. I also found out my car was used for some t-shirt promotion company. I didn’t even know about it till I saw it on Instagram.  
  
T-shirt Promotion:

I am pretty pissed at this point. I believe giving at least 1 year to get this project finished is being more than patient enough. I don't feel like that is absurd. I tried to call the shop but their number on their website is an old number that never got updated. It took a Facebook post to even reach them. When I do finally get a hold of the owner of the shop, he states his mechanic was in and out having problems and what not. He also blames his secretary on scheduling issues. His words were “I complain about your car every week that it doesn't get worked on.” I'm not sure what the has to do with me since it’s his shop and he's the owner that has to deal with it.  
  
I finally get fed up with this waiting and call my transporter to have the car picked up. When I dropped off the car, it was in pristine condition. Everyone who knows me knows I take great care of my car. 0 curb rashes, 0 missing parts on the car. Clean. The shop stated it was in an AC controlled room that was kept clean. They had wash the car tons of times which may have been during the first months the car was there since it was used in a promo shoot without my knowledge. This is what the car looked like when my transporter showed up.

Sure looks like it was kept clean.  
  
When I finally got the car back, there was a mark on the wheel that needs to get repaired, missing a triangle under the side mirror which took them 3 months to send a new one, new scratches from not caring enough or proper storage. The trunk lip is now faded also probably from sitting outside every day. Some bird shit that’s been caked on the roof and has been there for god knows how long. Thankfully, I was planning to have the car detailed and remove the trunk lip for a stock wing again. I still don’t understand why I have such bad luck with this car.  
  
Year 3.5 - 4:  
  
A local guy up here in Sacramento who owns Overkill Performance reached out to me after making a review post about my experiences with the Southern California shop. The post about the Southern California shop got deleted about 20 minutes after it was posted. I’m sure the admins on the page are friends of the shop or the shop is very good at damage control.  
  
The owner of OKP asked to try them and see if we can get this goal of a built evo done correctly. This was my last stop. If this doesn't work. I won't even try a built block anymore and will just buy a stock long block and put it in. Within the month he had the engine out of the car and then torn down. As fast as this build was going now, I got the worst possible news that I could have received. The pictures will show everything. This was a brand new long block, everything brand new. 800 miles.  
  
Short block tear down:

 It was noted that the head wasn't torqued down to spec. Instead of using proper gaskets, it was gasket maker? There were missing copper washers and mismatched bolts. The biggest thing was the bearing on the balance shaft delete was installed incorrectly. Brand new $600 CP pistons ruined, brand new $700 "" I "" beam Manley rods ruined, bearings, gasket kit, oil pump, oil cooler and whatever else I have to replace. I am building a 2nd car but only ending up with one.  
  
The home stretch:  
  
Now that the car is only about 1 hour away. I can visit the car and see the progress that is being done on the car. The communication is also leaps and bounds ahead of what I previously experienced. After the tear down and going over options on what to do next. I went ahead and opted to do another rebuild and start from scratch. I want this build to be as perfect as can be from the start. We ended up replacing all the gaskets, new pistons, a new rod, new oil pump and other misc. items that were needed. I also opted to upgrade the transmission this time around since I wanted to enjoy the car before I sheer the gears.  
  
I went ahead and updated the turbo to a current gen, sold off the wide body, got a few things polished.

After waiting for about a month or so, the machine shop finally got around to balancing the new crank, pistons and rods. This wait was probably the hardest since we are soo close to the end and I was getting impatient.

Now that the car is back together. I had a custom A/C unit made for this to accommodate the forward facing turbo. With more parts, comes more problems. The original dump tube won’t fit unless routed over the manifold. So, for now we decided to do a hood dump. I’m not sure how annoying with the soot this is going to be but, I’ll just drive it and enjoy it for now.

First startup since the 2nd rebuild:  
https://youtu.be/UuvtBx9lk8o  
  
After driving the car around a bit, the car shut off. Diagnosing the problem turned out to be a popped fuse. Then all of a sudden saw the wiring mess under the dash. Who uses this much tape? More work to be done and another setback for a bit.

The day finally came to pick up the car and I was to take it for a test drive and break it in for the up coming Japanese super car cruise (JSCC) event. With random problems coming up with the car, I didn’t think I would have it broken in time and have it tuned. I was putt putting the car around getting use to the feel of it and was told that I was not supposed to go over 5k during break in. Apparently, everyone at the shop knew how excited I was and kept it all a secret that it was finished. Here is the video of my first sit in with the car and how shocked, excited and other mixed emotions that my car finally works and runs how it should.  
  
Surprise video of the car running:

Current power level on low boost: 615 awhp and 423lbs of trq @ 32psi  
https://imgur.com/Td19Koa  
  
The current tuner tells me that I have about another 10psi to go if I really want to turn it up. I’ll settle on a low boost tune for now and maybe once I get used to the current power levels to break 700awhp. But in the end,  more power comes with more problems.  
  
Here is the image of the total cost of my Evo in the last 10 years and some change. Just remember this is over the past 10 years and I didn’t have all the money at once. The first and second rebuild were within a 4-year span.  
  
Total cost of the Evo as it current sits:

The breakdown of cost:  
Total spent YTD including cost of Evo: $88303    
First rebuild: $14560  
Second rebuild: $13347  
  
Sometimes, it’s better off not putting everything down on an excel sheet.  
  
Final thoughts:    
This has taken so long that I got married, bought a house and a few new cars within the time that my car has been down. I got a new job and promotion. Life moved on while my car sat still.  
  
I have always heard horror stories of people being screwed by shops but I would never expected it to be me. I thought I had done my research and picked shops out carefully. However, in the end, I still got burned. I have learned a lot and just chalked it up as an expensive learning experience. I left the names of the shops out because what’s the past is the past. I have moved on and will share my experience with whoever is willing to listen or when asked for recommendations. I have friends who have been with me through these last 4 years with me have seen it all and can vouch for anything that has been posted.  
  
I’ve learned that you just need to speak up. When I tell people how long I have waited or how long shops have taken, people tell me to speak up and be up front. I believe I was being naïve in believing that my car was going to be delivered or finished on time. I was too patient about it all. Now I have lost most of the drive to do another crazy project. As I’ve gotten older and lived without the Evo, I have come to appreciate the basic bolt on car. I just want to get into a car and drive and not worry about something break, rattling loose, cause some sort of unwanted headache. On the other hand, I also know we all are car people. Nothing stays stock and we all get the mod bug sooner or later.    
  
I just want to thank the guys at Overkill Performance in Sacramento that took care of me. Every step of the way they informed me what was going on and I was treated like family. I know at times I could have been that annoying customer but, they insisted I wasn’t and knew that excitement of getting the car back after 3.5-4 years of waiting to finally drive a properly built car. I know I’m in good hands and that I wouldn’t be hesitant to recommend them to anyone. Maybe they’ll help me on my next project.  
  
At this point, my car is a forever car. I’ll probably never get rid of it since I’m soo deep into it. It holds a certain sentimental value and prove to me that with enough time and dedication, the projects will get done with the right people around you. It may just not be cars, it can be other things in life also. I’ll just continue to drive the Evo and finally enjoy it after being away for so long. What to do from here? Just drive the car and enjoy it.",2
"Lets chat about the Fiesta ST.
In my place of employment, like any other working environment, we end up with some new employees from time to time. The unfortunate part of what I do puts me in a world of people who have very little interest in cars, as a result people I know rarely drive anything ""interesting."" As luck would have it, I struck up a conversation with one of the new hires, and as it turned out he happened to be really interested in cars. Naturally, the first question I ask him after finding out about his hobby is ""soooo, what do you drive?""
""A brand new Fiesta ST"" he says. Well, naturally I have to go check it out, we make plans after work to meet up in the parking lot, and to my delight, I see a COBB access port sitting on the dashboard, a straight pipe exhaust, and an aftermarket air intake mated to a completely custom tune. 
How utterly exciting. 
Having driven a bog standard base model Fiesta ST at a dealership the year before, I had to break the car guy code, I had to ask if I could have a go. But he beat me to the punch. ""Do you want to drive it?"" he says. ""But of course!"" I say, trying to hold in my overflowing excitement. 
The stock Fiesta ST feels absolutely great, its a ""point and click"" kind of car, you want it to go somewhere? It does it. The handling is razor sharp, the steering is direct and instant. This car has some special kind of charisma, like a small dog that has no fear of anything larger or more intimidating. 
And it shouldn't have any fear. Because, hand on heart, this Fiesta ST is far more fun then cars that I have driven that are double its price. With the exhaust and tune the owner claimed it was making around 230 horsepower and 270 Ft/lbs of torque. In a Fiesta ST?! No way. I don't buy it.
First off, creeping through the parking lot and driving on the slow residential roads, the car feels docile, timid. Its actually reasonably comfortable, although the Recaro leather seats are a bit on the snug side, with some time they probably will feel like a well used baseball glove. The only hint that you are in something special happens when you reach down and feel the metal leather wrapped shift knob, and hunt for your next gear. 
Its very easy to drive, and this is a something I have noticed with every fast Ford I have ever driven; Focus SVT, Contour SVT, Fiesta ST, Focus ST, they all have these wonderfully light and easy to operate inputs that would even make learning to drive a manual gearbox easy and un-intimidating. The clutch is easy and very forgiving if you let it out too quickly, and the shifter, while a bit rubbery feeing, started to feel right at home after working through the gears a few times. 
I leave the complex that my work is on, and take the car down a set of roads with a few round-abouts that are rarely driven. Now, I knew the Fiesta ST was a monster in the handling department, but what I did not expect was the shove of power that this aftermarket tune would do to this car. Simply put; its a game changer. In stock form the Fiesta ST is worth every penny, its quick, its nimble, its fun, its reliable, and it gets great fuel economy, but put a tune on it? Oh man. What a treat. In stead of the turbo coming on at lower RPM, stock is around 2000 RPM, the tune raised full boost to around 2900, so there is a little bit of low end torque loss (and its hardly noticeable) but when that turbo comes on in full force, this ST goes into ""RS"" mode, its a rocket ship. I became giddy, and somewhat drunk with power. I had to keep reminding myself ""Not your car iamnotcreativeDET, not your car."" In the wet this little terrier was clawing for traction in 1st, 2nd, and 3rd gear. The owner says ""some of my muscle car buddies make fun of it for not having that much straight line performance."" and I respond ""no way, this is the sweet spot for a front wheel drive hatchback, bigger power just means more problems. This thing is a fucking riot!"" 
I go for one last squirt down a straight, and run the motor up to redline (of course with the owner's permission), after hitting redline, and quickly shifting to the next gear, the exhaust lets out a loud ""POP!"" and dips down in revs, the turbo spools back up and shoves the car back into full force. 
We return back to the parking lot where my Jetta is parked, I get out and walk around the car, and find out the car is rolling on steelies with General Altimax SNOW TIRES! WHAT?!! I couldn't believe it. I absolutely couldn't believe how responsive and fun this thing was running on less than ideal rubber. ""You should try it again when I put the Bridgestones back on in the spring."" he says. ""deal.""
This has me rethinking my game plan for next fun car, I was considering saving my cash and going the direction of a Mustang GT or a used C6 Corvette. But maybe I will consider finding a left over Fiesta ST, since its going to get harder to find them as they start to age more, considering Ford pulled the plug on the next generation car. Anybody considering one as their next car purchase, whatever compromise you have to make to get one, I say DO IT! Every minute and part of your day will be devoted to ""when can I drive it next?"" And thats the way a fun car should be. ",2
"My First V8! 6.2L of Fury, my New Corvette
She finally arrived a bit over 7 months from when I ordered her. My 2019 Corvette Grand Sport. I traded in my 2016 V6 Camaro on it and I am not disappointed! I wanted a C7 ever since I saw one a few months after buying the Camaro. I took the leap in August last year when I found that the 2018s were making a few interior changes which allowed me to save over 5k so I began my search.
I couldn't find the car I wanted on any dealer lots (Its slim picking up here in Canada) and the used selection was even worse. I ended up ordering the car when the plant was shut down. When the plant came back online it was Winter so I had to wait until now to receive the car.
Options List:
-2LT Trim
-Automatic (Can't drive stick very well)
-Torch Red
-Adrenaline Red Interior with the Two-Tone seat inserts
-Carbon Fibre Instrument Panel
-Transparent Roof
-Carbon Flash Hood Stinger Stripe
-Carbon Flash Badges and Mirrors
-Red Seat Belts
-Black Satin Wheels with Red Stripe
I really didn't want another black interior, especially on the Corvette. The only colour options are Brown, Grey, Black and Red. I'm not 50 so I didn't want Brown or Grey and the full Red interior is a bit too much red for me. However if you option the Two-Tone seat option it brings in some black contrasting which makes it look nicer. I then went with all the black on red contrasting I could option and the result is pretty great.
In terms of how it compares to my Camaro. Obviously the power is greater, I haven't opened it up yet as its still in the break-in but the car really begs to be driven harder. There is a ton of steering feedback, my Camaros steering wasn't bad by any means but this is a lot better. Its more comfortable then my Camaro. It might have just been my size but after awhile driving the Camaro I couldn't get comfortable on longer trips and I would constantly be fidgeting trying to find that perfect spot of zen, not in the Corvette, these GT seats are wonderful. The sound, good lord the sound. My V6 had the performance exhaust and sounded pretty good for a V6, but this, oh my god, I could wake the devil himself just by starting the car. The whole car vibrates to that V8 rumble in a subtle way where its not annoying if your just sitting in traffic but you can feel it just enough to know you got something special.

"My dad is selling his dream car and it's making me sad.
Last summer my old man (70) bought himself his dream car, a 911 Carrera.  No, it's not a super car or some crazy thing, but it was dream his whole life to own a Porsche 911.  
https://imgur.com/a/JTWXZ
He's had it for about a year, bought it CPO, 8000 miles in flawless condition, but doesn't really enjoy driving it (Oklahoma roads suck) and so it just sits.
I (40) take it out for lunch and the occasional sprint down the street during lunch breaks, but alas he wants to sell.  Not because he needs the money, he doesn't but because he just doesn't enjoy it anymore.
I'm trying to convince him to let me have it, but so far I'm failed in my attempts. :-)
Today I took it to the Porsche dealer and they are working on quote to purchase it outright.
I'm sad and there isn't anything I can do about it, as I have 2 kids, one on the way and my wife would shoot me in the face if I bought a Porsche.",2
"Yesterday I got a 2015 Mustang EcoBoost. Here are my initial thoughts (and pictures of course!).
[Album!](http://imgur.com/a/HkzfB)
I picked up a 2015 Mustang EcoBoost yesterday. First, some specs:
* 2.3L turbocharged 4 cyl, 310 HP and 320 lb-ft.
* 3.55 limited-slip differential
* 6 speed MT82 manual transmission
* 19""x9"" wheels with Pirelli 255/40 tires
* about 3550 lbs
* Recaro seats
First off, pictures do not do the sixth-generation (S550) Mustang justice. Such a curvy, well-styled body. Panel fit is excellent. If you sat me down in this car five years ago, I would never have guessed it's a Ford. The interior quality is superb, with soft-touch materials everywhere your hands will touch (and then some). The Recaros are very supportive, and also comfortable enough for long drives. Back seat space is (of course) a joke, but it makes a nice place to throw your backpack. The instrument panel is very informative, with large, easy to read gauges that provide more information than you'll ever need. The left pod has the tachometer and coolant temperature gauges, the right pod has the speedometer and fuel gauges, and atop the center stack is an oil pressure gauge, and boost/vacuum gauge. If this isn't enough information, the center screen can display the air/fuel ratio, cylinder head temperature, oil temperature, and electrical system voltage. The shifter is short and precise. Clutch is light; definitely lighter than I'm used to (my last manual was an LT1 Camaro), but engages a lot more ""reasonably"" than Mustangs of yesteryear. 
Because it's winter and I live in Michigan, I haven't been able to push the performance envelope much. more than 75%+ throttle in any gear 3rd and below causes wheelspin, thanks to the cold temperatures and summer tires. On the highway, the car pulls like a 90's V8 - the flat, broad mid-range torque curve is very evident here. Cornering with the stiff Performance Pack springs and independent rear suspension is excellent, but I hesitated to push it hard because of the conditions. The ride quality is better than the live-axle Mustangs by a longshot, but the stiffer springs are very evident here - you can still feel the bumps. I averaged 27 MPG on the highway, which is about where I would expect for 87 octane fuel and the 3.55 rear end. Maybe it will increase more as the engine breaks in.",2
"My 1990 Nissan 300ZX Twin Turbo
I saw a couple other users post about their Zs recently and thought I'd share mine. I've had this car since 2008, and it was my daily driver for most of that time. Owning it has had a pretty huge impact on my life. It's created friendships and even changed my entire career path. 
[At the previous owner's house before I bought it](http://i.imgur.com/wdkmh.jpg)
[At the PO's house](http://i.imgur.com/1I5aP.jpg)
[Then shortly after I bought it](http://i.imgur.com/PgVuh.jpg)
For the first few years I had it, everything that could break, broke twice. Being a poor kid right out of high school, keeping it on the road was a struggle. But I learned a lot about the platform and managed to keep it going. In 2012 I did a mild rebuild on it, pulling the motor and had a built motor done by a trusted engine builder. I later converted it to run on E85 and did some other mods in the meantime. 
During that first real build in 2012:

[New motor done](http://i.imgur.com/scbbo.jpg)
[ECU porn from the E85 conversion](http://i.imgur.com/z4KDIgi.jpg)
Unfortunately, during that build, the heads were machined incorrectly and the valvetrain started making some really unhappy noises. It also developed a massive leak between the oil pump and block (the paper gasket split), and the turbos were beyond blown. So I pulled the motor again early last year and did another mild build. This time I kept the same block from 2012, but had a fresh set of heads built (the last set was trashed), new turbos, manifolds, and a lot more.

Today, almost nothing on the car is stock. I don't think there's a single bolt on the car that I haven't turned at some point. It now has over 200k miles and I still have plenty more planned for it.

I haven't really done a proper photoshoot on it since having ""finished"" it this last time around, with the fresh paint and all. But it's not going to stay like this for long anyway. The stock wastegates on these turbos are keeping me around only 17 psi of boost. I was running ~20psi on my old setup, and would like to push this setup to around 25psi, where it should make well over 500whp. This car has never been about big power, just about being a lot of fun on the street.
**tl;dr** bought a Z32 in 2008, it's been an absolute nightmare to keep running, but now it's better than ever and I wouldn't trade it for anything.

"Sold truck, new owner promptly blows the motor, calls me to complain
I had a 85 C30 1 ton Dually for sale. 3 speed auto, 4.1 rears. I had it for a year, I have had it on the highway with 2000+ lbs of mulch in the back. I have towed my 280Z 40 miles each way with the A/C on. It's never overheated. But without an overdrive, I never exceeded 60 mph on it since that's like 4000+ RPM (no tach so I dunno for sure).
This guy buys it. I was up front in the ad; I tell him on a hot day the temp. gauge goes up if you have the A/C on. I turned it off after seeing that and never let it overheat. I tell him it's hard to start when cold, because it's carbureted. I had pics of all the rust. I told him the interior had been swapped, etc., etc. He assures me he's familiar with old cars because he has a TV car business. He just picked up another C30 the other day, and so on. Says he wants to pick it up last night, after 10pm. Uh, ok.
The deal's done; he's driving home with someone driving a second car. An hour later I get an angry call from them that it overheated. Puts the phone next to a whistling radiator cap, presumably. All these old cars he's bought and mine's the first one that broke down. I thought about offering to come out and bring water for the radiator... but that wasn't a good idea. They said something about calling 911 on the phone. They deal with classic cars and they don't have a plan if it breaks down? You don't dial 911...
I got texted a picture of it being towed and the words ""blown motor"". I didn't get any sleep since I didn't know if this guy was going to have it towed back here and demand a refund, or drive back here in the tail vehicle and demand some compensation, or murder me and my family or what.
After thinking about it, the only way I can see it overheating barring some cooling system failure is he just wanted to get home quick and was trying to cruise at 75+ MPH, and maybe the cooling system just doesn't work that well at those engine speeds. But I dunno, and it's not my problem. You bought a 30 year old truck, decided to drive it home at night, and didn't keep an eye on the temp gauge and blew a headgasket or whatever these old big blocks do when you overheat them.
But I don't know how to say that to this guy in a way that makes him not want to murder me.",2
"Confession: I secretly wish my car would break down.
I bought a used 04' camry back during my freshman year of college for a few grand (my whole savings at the time). It had around \~197k miles at the time, and I was worried back then that it might not last until I could graduate and start working a full time job. Fast forward to today, I graduated 2 years ago and the damn thing is still running, with 252k miles on it. I've driven it like a maniac, did really infrequent oil changes, and didn't even realize transmission fluid was a thing. This is even more amazing considering I drove for door dash very aggressively back during college, so think lots of city driving during those years. At the same time, I now make enough to want to get a modern car (could really use carplay and a backup camera) but it's hard to justify it since everything still works perfectly, with the only complaint I have being the power windows make a slight creak in cold weather and the AC's takes around 10 minutes to perfectly cool the cabin at full blast.",2
"I have an idea for a racing open world simulator.
Hear me out I suppose. It's essentially a mixture of Forza, Midnight Club LA, and the technical aspects of Gran Turismo. 
The environment would be based on an open world city like Chicago, Houston, Atlanta, or Dallas. A city with a rich car culture, not including New York or LA considering they've been used many many times with other open world type games. 
The protagonist would be a young car enthusiast that just got his/her license and they're trying to absorb the car culture around them. But instead of having the player start with a slow car and get faster cars as the career progresses, I wanted to step it up a notch. Make the player start with a sub-$1,000 car way past its service life. Base model versions of sports cars from yesteryear. Examples would be the 94-98 V6 Mustang, 95-99 420A Eclipse/Talon, 92-95 Single cam Civic sedan, 80s V6 Fbody, etc in the ""Craigslist special"" fashion. Worn piston rings, leaky seals, slipping clutch, grinding trans, rattle can primer gray paint job, bald Chinese knock off tires, etc. 
As you can probably tell, repairs gas and maintenance would be included in the sim which would directly affect the way the car performs. The cars would even experience break downs if the player neglects the car, or if they run out of gas. 
Racing and certain events would happen all across the city. Highway roll racing and digs would be prevalent in the streets, centered around both legal and illegal car meets. 
Aside from street racing, there would also be legal events like use of the local drag strip and autocross/drift events. 
I also thought about incorporating real race tracks as an added bonus, like Road Atlanta and Laguna Seca. But I also thought this may be overkill considering the game would already be ridiculously sophisticated for consoles as well as most PCs. 
Money could be made from races as well as doing delivery jobs for random places, and maybe even a make shift Uber that somehow allows you to use your dilapidated 2 door car. 
As the story progresses, the player will obviously get the chance to buy newer and faster cars. But instead of the traditional format where you can buy a R34 Skyline, Cobra R, or a Jag XJ220 brand new with 0 miles on it, the cars that can be bought are reflective of what's in the current market for the area. Cars that are not 2017 models cannot be bought new, only used. Also, there would be no guarantee the exact car you want will be available. 
In short, it would be more of a real world scenario vs a traditional racing game. Start at the absolute bottom with a minimal budget, and build from there. 
Btw, if this idea has already been done and I'm just out of the loop, I'm truly sorry for this waste of bandwidth. ",2
"The Reality of Owning an Old German Super Sedan (My E55 Story)
 
Hi all, this is my first post on Reddit! I've been lurking for a long time but finally decided to post something.
**Warning:** This is long, but I want to share as much as I can for someone looking to get into this stuff.
So we've all heard the stories on old German luxury cars. Some say they're the best things since sliced bread due to the depreciation (Tavarish), others say to avoid them like the plague (Scotty Kilmer). Personally, I think they're all right to a degree, since these cars vary so wildly in condition. If you find the right one, it can be awesome and rewarding. Get an example with 13 previous owners and a sketchy VIN history report, then yeah, you're *probably* going to have a bad time.
Around 14 months ago, I made the decision to plunge head first into the world of out-of-warranty German cruise missiles. The lease was ending on my Focus, and I had always lusted over the idea of going fast while getting my butt massaged for cheap. In retrospect, I had no business even thinking about getting an older car with high maintenance costs; the most I had ever done on a vehicle was change the oil. This was also going to be my **only** car. But I thought ""hey, all these people on the Internets are doing it, why cant I?"" So the search began.
I eventually settled on a 2003-2006 W211 chassis Mercedes E55 AMG. I chose this for a few reasons. 1) there is a *massive*community online for these things, and pretty much every problem has already been solved and documented on a forum. 2) this was one of the last ""easy"" AMG's to work on, as not many special tools are needed and most maintenance items are accessible without much hassle. And the biggest one, 3) these engines and drivetrains are known for being extremely reliable (my **only** car, remember?). There's a famous video of a 400k mile original engine E55 putting down similar power numbers to factory spec on a dyno. For really any car with that mileage, that's impressive. Oh yeah and it also had 469hp and 516 ft/lbs of torque bone stock. I was sold.
I found a fantastic example, a 2004 1-owner car with just under 100k miles. The only problem was... it was on the opposite side of the country. The car was in Seattle, I'm in Detroit. I had only ever bought one car in my life (the Focus at age 18) and had literally no idea what to do, but it looked *so damn good.* So naturally, I went to [Internet.com](https://internet.com/) and figured out what to do for buying a car site unseen. I had the dealer drive the car to a nearby Mercedes shop to have a PPI done. This is **absolutely critical** with these high-end luxury cars. You might visually see nothing wrong and have no CEL's, but there can be a whole lot wrong under the surface once the dealer-specific computers are plugged in. Everything checked out good, and once financing was set up (yes I'm young and dumb and financed an old site-unseen German car) I was ready to go.
A booked flight later and some hotels reserved (shout-out to those hotel rewards points) and I was in Seattle with my new baby. If you ever have the chance to do a cross-country road trip, **do it.** It was spectacular, especially while going through the mountains at \*insert expensive ticket here\* speeds. 2500 miles and 1 week later and I was home without the car missing a beat.
But anyways, getting to answering the question of why you're here: how much does it really cost to daily drive one of these things? Answer: **It's complicated.** Let me explain.
If you're going to directly compare this to the running costs of a similar year and mileage Corolla, it's no question; the AMG (or whatever you get) is going to be much more expensive. Go ahead, make Scotty Kilmer's day and buy the more reasonable car. There's nothing wrong with that! What Scotty won't tell you, though, is that these old super sedans *are a fucking blast.* Nothing puts a smile on your face like a ridiculously overpowered 4 door sleeper, especially when you start to realize there's not much on the road that's faster than you. Okay fine, maybe taking corners in an old Miata is more fun, but here in Michigan we don't have those things called ""corners.""
Being a person who had never really done much car maintenance/repairs before this, the E55 has been surprisingly enjoyable to work on. If you have some basic tools and a jack/jack stands, you can do most of the stuff yourself. These cars aren't that much different than anything else, and have enough room to get your hands where they need to be (unlike many modern engine bays). Parts aren't that expensive, as long as you don't pay the Mercedes tax. You can avoid this by using [www.fcpeuro.com](https://www.fcpeuro.com/) , as you can get OEM parts for a fraction of the dealer cost. The warranty is cool too. [www.mbworld.org](https://www.mbworld.org/) has lots of useful DIY's and other information, along with many other M-B specific forums. If you understand basic mechanics, you'll be fine. This car has essentially forced me to learn how to fix a car myself, as 1) it's my only car and 2) if I went to the dealership for every repair I would be living in a tent in a Detroit alley. My car would be cool though!
So onto the juicy numbers. In my exactly 1 year of ownership, I have put 27k miles on the car. My overall average MPG (60% highway 40% city) is about 17.5mpg on premium. I have been stranded 0 times (knock on lacquered interior wood trim).
And the fun stuff, the maintenance items. This is what I've done off the top of my head. Everything was done in my garage with basic hand tools and a jack with jack stands, other than the engine rear main seal since the whole trans had to be dropped.
* both motor mounts
* transmission mount
* valve cover gaskets
* breather cover RTV gaskets
* oil cooler housing seals
* heater control valve
* all brake pads and rotors (they're massive on this car, 8 piston front, 4 piston back, made by Brembo)
* crankshaft position sensor
* thrust arms (front control arms)
* lower ball joints
* outer tie rods
* stabilizer bar links
* spark plugs (takes 16!)
* intercooler water pump
* supercharger pulley belt
* alarm siren
* front wheel bearings and hubs
* alternator
* about 5 oil changes (every 5k miles)
* I also purchased an advanced MB-specific scan tool for \~$150 that allows me to read some dealer-level codes and do intermediate diagnostics.
In total, I have probably spent around $3k in maintenance on this car in my 1 year of ownership, and Lord knows how much in gas. The E55 runs great now and feels like it hasn't lost any of its 469 ponies.
Would I do it all again? *Hell yes.* I know, I know, it costs a lot to maintain and register and whatever, but this is one of those cars you can't imagine giving up. Could it just be an emotional attachment of some kind? Sure, but you forget about that every time you put your foot down. It's no Hellcat, but it's fun making Mustang owners mad when they get gapped by a 14 year old car with a mountain bike on the roof.
**TL;DR**, to conclude my ridiculously long first ever post, if you're looking to buy an old German super sedan, follow these steps:
1. Do your homework
2. Get a PPI from a dealer
3. Don't jump on the first car you see
4. Realize it's not a Corolla
5. Always keep an ""emergency fund"" for when that one expensive thing breaks
6. Wave goodbye to the Challenger SRT while your butt is being massaged... *in style*

"Just had the most hilariously infuriating dealer experience and I'd like to share it with you all.
Unfortunately my vehicle was totaled in an accident recently and my parents and I corroborated to have them purchase a new vehicle and pass down an older vehicle of theirs to me as a temporary replacement. They wanted to bring me along for the buying process as I have prior dealer experience (sales & inventory acquisition). I was supposed to ensure they achieved the best deal and also make sure they didn't get screwed. Lets just say I did my job flawlessly. 
&nbsp;
Their primary contender is a 2018 Toyota Camry XSE V6, white/black with the cockpit red interior. Quite a rare combination, so this vehicle is not that easy to find. They found one with all the options they wanted, only 30 miles away, in new condition and a fair asking price. With my approval on the price, they called the dealer and told them to start the paperwork. I could already tell they were getting far too emotionally vested into the vehicle, but hey, its a new car at a good price and its exactly what they wanted. What could go wrong?
&nbsp;
When we arrived the car was up front in all of its glory. I did a small walk around and observed more than normal wear for a new vehicle on the front fascia (rock chips, bugs all over, scratches on the plastic). At this time my mother was in the front seat checking it out, and I asked her what the mileage was. 
&nbsp;
""2,800"", she says. I asked again if it was a new car they were considering as no new car should have anywhere near 2,800 miles, let alone even 100. The saleswoman offered her explanation, this was the general managers demo vehicle. Uh oh, enormous red flag here. Dealer trying to pass off a used demo vehicle as a new car. My dad n' mum weren't all that concerned with the additional mileage (again, too emotionally vested) or the abnormal wear and tear on the front fascia. The deal was good and they were okay with it being a demo. In they went to begin the credit app and get started on the paperwork.
&nbsp;
Meanwhile, I eyed this vehicle with more scrutiny than I ever had buying cars for the dealership I worked for. Very quickly I was finding signs of abuse. The more minor instances of damage I located included heavy scuffing on the ground effects, rock chips/scratches on the front fascia, rock chips on the hood (though this had clear bra so I'm not so sure they penetrated to the paint), and pretty bad curb rash on both rear wheels. It was shaping up to be a very poor condition vehicle, especially for only 2800 miles. This is very bad because it also means it was likely abused during the break in period. I caught a glimpse of a piece of the bumper that was missing paint near where the lower bumper begins to meet the wheel well (closest to the ground). I took a closer look and discovered the car had been dragged pretty severely on that bumper, likely when leaving a steep driveway at an angle. It did enough damage to pull the bumper out of place and ruin the skid plate. I knew the bumper had been pulled out of place as there was small chip where the top of the bumper meets the wheel well and the metal fastener in this location was completely mangled. Enough so that the wheel well plastic no longer stayed in place. In addition to this, I found a minor nick on the right rear quarter panel accompanied by some bubbling. Yes, a 2018 that was already rusting. 
&nbsp;
I immediately went in to relay my findings to my folks. They stopped what they were doing and came outside to observe exactly what I did. I could see the frustration building in the saleswoman. She hated me. I told my parents that unless we can get this car under 30k, walk away. I also made a point that whoever (in this case the general manager) operated this vehicle did not take care of it. For a car with 2800 miles to have curb rash, relatively severe front bumper damage, rusting, among other minor issues, it would have to have been treated fairly poorly. The saleswoman was furious that I had even brought any of this up, and became combative, getting in my face and aggressively stating they ""take pride in their vehicles"" and they ""most certainly take care of them"" and she ""didn't appreciate my slanderous words about the company"". I simply pointed out that the car obviously hadn't been taken care of as evidenced by my findings. After pointing out all the issues again my literal words were ""this car wasn't fuckin' taken care of, clearly"" in a sarcastic tone. The F bomb threw her over the edge (Okay, maybe I shouldn't have swore. It was impulsive and unwarranted. However, being in sales, it's not that uncommon someone is dissatisfied with the vehicle you're offering, and occasionally they resort to foul language. Who cares. You're a salesperson. It's your job to soak that up, apologize for quality issues, and see what you can do about getting the customer into something that will meet their expectations. They were trying to screw my parents, and I took that personally).
&nbsp;
Anyhow, we asked about negotiating the price down and she went in to grab her manager. Guess who came to greet us? The general manager, exactly who used and abused the shit out of this poor car.  He came out and we introduced ourselves, he asked if I had used foul language with his employee and I confirmed I had, also offering my apology for having done so. His next words were ""thanks for confirming, due to this we will not be doing business with you"". Go figure the one who tore that poor car up would be the one to kick us out. In reality, it had nothing to do with the fact I said a bad word. I was wasting their time, they knew they weren't getting a sale and didn't feel like working with an informed buyer. I started laughing and just turned straight for the car to get the hell out of there. We piled up and on our way we went. It was for the best.
&nbsp;
Not so bad. Shady dealer trying to sell a used car as new, damaged with a shady history. We didn't buy it, so on to the next, right? Nope, not even a minute after leaving the lot we get a call from the dealer. They ASKED US TO COME BACK IN SO WE CAN TALK THINGS OVER AND COME TO A DEAL. I'm sorry. I'm not even shitting you they kicked us the fuck out and said come back in we can make this work. My dad received the call, and as the nice guy that he is he simply said he was going to look at other options. I couldn't believe it. Figured I'd share with you guys since I know you all love a negative dealer story. With that, a great segway into a tldr.
&nbsp;
**tl;dr: parents need a vehicle, found exactly what they want advertised as new, turns out it was used with 2800 miles and beat to shit in unsuspecting areas. Saleswoman became combative after I pointed out the issues, I offered a profane rebuttal, we were kicked out. They called us not even a minute later asking us to come back so we can work it out and come to a deal**
&nbsp;
edit:
So to clear up a few things. Most of you understand the story and where I am coming from but I'm hearing a few voices that are saying I was way out of line here, and I'd like to address those voices. I don't believe so. I never once raised my voice or became belligerent with the salesperson. They instigated by raising their tone and talking down to me as though what I was saying was not true. I simply stated it ""hadn't been fuckin' taken care of, clearly"" which, to me, isn't all that offense worthy. They didn't want to bother with us so they latched on to the sole expletive as a means to get us out. 
&nbsp;
In regards to a demo car still being new. I am aware a demo can still be a 'new' car. We were under the impression this car was new new, as in having never been used prior. Arriving to find a 2800mi demo beat to shit is grounds to be upset in my eyes.",2
"When you see a car driving down the road in the snow don't walk out infront of it!
Sorry for this rant but it's been bugging me for a bit now. I'm also on mobile so my formatting and spelling will be horrible.
 A few days ago we got enough snow to completely cover the roads even on the main roads and it stayed like that from atleast 5pm to 12am. I was driving down a main road going ~60km in my 1991 Firebird (no auto braking, break assist or any other fancy stuff like that) and I see a man standing at the end of the road wearing all black, he was on the sidewalk so I thought nothing of it. When I was just over a car length away I saw him look at my car then look forward and start walking across the road right infront of me. I slammed by breaks and started sliding so I started pumping them and veerd to the right and barley missed him.
The whole time I was honking and I know without a doubt that he saw me because I saw his eyes and my lights are very bright. There are some things I get irrationally angered about 1 someone putting me in harm's way 2 someone putting my SO in harm's way and 3. Getting in the way of my food. My SO was holding our food for the night, I never thought I would be the person to get out of a car and start screaming at a pedestrian but I came very close that night.
Sorry for the rant but it's been bugging me everytime I get in my car. Have a great day!",2
"Cobra Crown Vic update!!
Hey guys, about a year ago I posted about my car (https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/27pqm9/my_cobracrownvic/) and got a great reception and a lot of people asking me to post future updates.  Here's an update.  First off, i'm sorry I didn't post one earlier but shortly after I posted my original thread, I did a transmission swap and installed an upgraded supercharger and then had some serious engine problems.
Please refer to my old post (which is linked above) for the information about the old engine.  I had purchased a broken t56 out of a 2003 mustang cobra, which I rebuilt.  Pretty much as soon as I finished rebuilding that transmission, I got a raise at work and decided to sell that unit.  I then purchased a brand new t56 magnum 6 speed with a 2.97:1 first gear ratio.  I then found a VMP TVS 2.3 supercharger designed for a 2003-2004 Mustang Cobra ""Terminator"" (at a cost I couldn't pass up) which I also purchased and installed on the car.  I pulled the stock (and broken) automatic transmission out of the car, cut a hole in the floor for the shifter, and threw the 6 speed in.  Extensive modification was required, including cutting apart my transmission crossmember and rewelding it so I could bolt my transmission mount to it, I had a custom driveshaft made, picked out an aluminum flywheel and clutch combination, found a bellhousing, and modified all of the wiring.
I drove the car like that for the recommended amount of miles to ""break in"" the t56 magnum and then dropped the car off at my tuner (shameless plug Kevin Hand from Wicked Motorsports in Toms River, NJ).  With a 3"" pulley on the TVS making about 17psi, the car made 570rwhp and 525rwtq.
**Here's a video from that dyno session.**  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2CXkPZLD4c
The day I picked the car up from him it was raining, so I couldn't ""get on it"" as we say.  A couple of days later it was beautiful out, so I threw on my big fat drag radials and took the car for a spin.  And spin it did, in multiple meanings of the word.  Even with 305 width drag radials, the car would spin all the way through first gear.  I got it to hook up in second gear and man did that feel good.  As for the other meaning of the word spin?  The engine spun two rod bearings.  Reason?  Who knows.  I took the car home, did a bunch of troubleshooting, pulled the whole car apart, and dropped the engine off at an engine builder where they disassembled the whole engine and figured out it was two rod bearings.
Now let's talk about the new engine.  The company I bought the shortblock from originally was incredibly helpful and did everything they could to help me out.  They rebuilt my motor with very minimal cost to me.  My engine block was reused, a 4.6L iron block.  My rods were reused, Manley Pro Series i-beam rods.  My crankshaft was replaced with a ""forged 4.75L stroker crankshaft"", new Manley forged pistons were installed, my perfectly fine low mileage cylinder heads were reused but with new stainless steel valves, a new oil pump with custom gears was installed, and then it was shipped back to me.  I put some of the accessories back on, put the passenger's side exhaust header back on, and dropped the engine into the car.  Once in, I put the rest of the engine back together, put the transmission back in the car, primed the oil system, and the car wouldn't even turn over.  Dead battery, you say?  Oh yes, dead battery.  Hooked up a battery jump starter, car turned right over and purred like a kitten.
Just this past weekend I reached the amount of miles that would be considered ""break in miles"" for a new engine.  I am trying to schedule an appointment to have tail pipes made for my exhaust, as right now the mufflers have turn downs before the rear axle and the car is absurdly loud inside and out.  The drone is not enjoyable.  I'm hoping to schedule time for a dyno tune soon.
And some pictures when I was in the process of dropping in the new engine:

"I procharged my 2015 Stingray!
Only by sheer coincidence. I picked up the car exactly 365 days before first start with the procharger.
Here are a few pictures from my DIY install. But first...
1)Results! 60 mph - 90 mph time 3.2 seconds stock, 2.8 seconds after supercharger. Skip shift removed, 4 cyl mode removed. I requested a 93 octane tune but I don't know if procharger provided that or left it at 91. Plan to dyno tune it soon. Here is a datalog of a 3rd gear 55-105 run. Puts it above magazine tested z06 times and just below 911 Turbo S times and that's starting in 3rd so before 70 mph the car is at a bit of a disavantage. Safe to say the supercharger really starts galloping at ~4000 rpm:
60 to 70 takes 0.97 seconds,
70 to 80 takes 0.90 sec,
80 to 90 takes 1.00 sec, 
90 to 100 takes 1.03 sec.
[datalog!](http://i.imgur.com/C1ERgPe.jpg)
2) Now for the tough work. Open her up: instructions don't say to remove the hood yet and I don't know why, but thats the first thing I did. just 4 bolts with a 13mm. No need to touch the hood shocks. They don't get in the way.
[picture uno](http://i.imgur.com/0h1RtsW.jpg)
3) Air intake, hood scoop, small things. no problem.
4) Front bumper. All good until you pull the 2 clips off located to the inside of the headlights. DON'T PULL HARD. Pull up on the bumper just enough to get a screw driver in there and loosen the 2 bolts holding each bracket. Then the bumper just slides up.

5) Originally i lifted the car by the front section the K-Member then put jack stands on the rear section. This is great for stability and GM's preferred jack points. Problem is.... You can't pry the K-member down if you are using it to hold the car up,  took me a while to realize that. Moved the jack stands to the side locations, left them there for the rest of the install, very stable. Also, make sure you have a 3 ft or longer pry bar and lift the K-member by prying up at the sway bar brackets, super easy this way to put the spacers in, did it alone. Make sure you use some thick zipties for the radiator, mine broke 3 times cause they were weak while i moved it around.
6) Balancer bolt. Easy. So easy. I guess people have a hard time because they try an impact or a breaker bar on its own. Its physics guys. Put the car in 6th gear, have someone hold the brakes. Breaker bar with 4 foot pipe on it, took about as much force as torquing a tire lugnut. 1 minute job. Torqued back to 240 by having two people pull on the torque wrench (pipe was too narrow). Oh! Put belt on now and zip tie it like I did, makes it easy to put on later.

7) Woo supercharger on, since the bracket is such a nice fit, you can lean it on the power steering motor and start 1 bolt at a time, did it alone.
[picture d](http://i.imgur.com/URbqnV9.jpg)
8) Intercooler up. Wasn't very hard but definitely good to have two people, need to angle it one side at a time then it sits in the cradle. Or you could use a jack if doing it alone. Note that my leg bent that plastic support down a bit, nbd, made zero difference with the cover on.
[picture 13](http://i.imgur.com/qsPyVsc.jpg)
9) Spark plugs to ngk6510. Hardest part of the job by far. Take pictures of each step to make sure you got all the electric stuff right. Scary part. Need to pull fuse box out. Needle nose pliers worked for pulling 7 of the 8 wires with quite a bit of effort. The furthest back on passenger side took several tries for about 30 minutes. I wish i had some curved needle nose, that probably would have worked.
10) I wish i took pictures of the tubing and stuff. The only very hard one was the charge tube from the supercharger to the intercooler (horizontal). I used windex on all the charge tubes to make them slide in easy rather than WD-40, doesn't get your hands slippery and dries quickly after install. Theres no space there due to the coolant lines. The other side was okay. Only use the smaller hose clamps for the 3/8"" line or you'll run out for the 1/2"" lines. Hose routing was very easy and procharger provided plenty extra 1/2"" for you to route it which ever way you want. 
11) All bolted up and tuned. First startup. No engine codes.
[gnarly 10 second video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcxVdAMUEI&feature=youtu.be)
14) all done. putting trim back on. Hood took 1-2 adjustments to get gaps correct. It still bumped the left side intercooler rubber elbow when closing but just slightly and it does not cause any damage. I was very surprised there were zero rattles, squeaks, air leaks, etc. I did have to retighten the belt twice because I didn't tension it right. Tensioning is relatively easy. About 20 minute job. Just have to remove the throttle body rubber angle.

All in all I am pretty happy. Time wise, 12 hour job for two guys including breaks.

"Dropped car off at the shop. Shop literally closes the next day with no notice?!
I am in the middle of losing my mind about this. Need to vent and possibly get suggestions on a course of action in addition to what I have in mind. Here's what happened:
I noticed a sweet smell on my drive home on 3/28. No lights or warnings. I get home and as soon as I park, I notice that there is definitely something up. Smoke from what I assume burning coolant is coming out of the hood. I pop it open and there isn't any giant mess or immediate disaster. I do see coolant collecting and dropping under the car. On my drive to drop car off, my break pedal travel changes a bit and I'm not pressing the pedal further than before. Car still stops fine. Then my e-brake light comes on and I get the a warning message having to do with the brakes (I don't recall the exact message and forgot to write it down). I Drop car off at 9am at local shop that has helped me with finding an oil leak last year. Owner/head mechanic and I talk a bit and he takes a look. Says he has a good idea of what it is and will call me asap. I hear nothing that whole day and call them before close. I am given the ""we will give you a call as soon as we get to it"" type answer. Saturday I hear nothing (they're open typically for a while Saturday's) so I call and get their voicemail. No call back. I drive by and it looks closed. I hear nothing Monday. The entirety of last week went by and I heard nothing. I have tried calling them every single day. Their voicemail says they closed due to unfortunate events and will be open again soon. The voicemail assures us that we're a valued customer. They have a notice/sign on their front door that is verbatim what their outgoing voicemail is. 
Today I decided I was going to call them again and then decide on something, anything. I called them and again they did not answer, but this time, their voicemail is full. I don't know what to do. I want my car back. I don't even know if I can drive it out of there at this point. I feel like shit and both defeated and angry. I'm calling the local police non-emergency number tomorrow to talk to someone about this and see if there is anything I can do outside of just contacting an attorney. 
I have a bad feeling that something bad happened to the owner or his family, but I have to think about me and my family at the same time. I can't leave this car out there indefinitely. Does anyone have any suggestions on things I could try? I drove by today and saw that their garage bay doors have slot windows in them. I'm going to see if I can peek in and at least confirm that my car is still physically there. My wife assumes the worst, that the guy basically stole everyone's car. But why would he do that? The place has been in business successfully for years and that seems so far fetched and impossible. 
Thanks for reading this mess. It helps a bit even to just get it all out. 
TL;DR Dropped car off at the shop. Over 1 week w/no contact, now shop VM says it's closed.
Edit: Located in Northern Chicago suburbs in the US. Sorry didn't think to add that.
Update: Called shop. VM still full. Stopped by and my car is in one of their garages with the hood open. Seems they at least attempted to work on it. Called local PD. They said I could file a missing/stolen car report if I wanted but that he probably just got sick. He knew of the place and didn't know of any official closings. He said it sounds like I'm going to be getting a discount on my service 😂.",2

"Whats your experience being ""Prius Huntes""?
TLDR at the bottom
I live in a rural area so I definitely get slack for driving a Prius from friends (mostly jokes cause heck, why not). But yesterday while on my way to school I was  ""hunted"" for the first time. 
While I was on the highway (one lane going either way) I was being tailgated very hard by some guy in a lifted diesel ram truck. I'm a little irritated by this cause I was going 70 (in a 65! Lock me up), and had otherwise been a perfect driver. But apparently that wasn't good enough for him, as he decided to pass me by driving into the oncoming traffic lane, there was one car coming but it was admittedly far enough away.
So whatever, I slow down so he doesn't get himself or someone else killed. He gets back in the right lane in front of me,  then slows down to 40ish mph. Im not in any rush I'm just mad irritated at this point, then he let's out a huge, thick plume of black smoke. I lay on my horn, but obviously a man of his intellect can't be bothered by that because he let's out even more smoke, time and time again.
So he speeds off, easily going 85+ mph, and I start going 65. ""At least that's over"" I think. Nope! Because a few moments later, wouldn't you believe we're stopped at the same light! (It's two lanes now, and theirs one car in front of us both)
I look over (and up) at him, he looks down at me. I give him a ""what's up"" / wave. And go back to waiting for the light to turn green. And when it does boy was I in for a surprise! 
 We start moving and before we get out of the intersection this dude swerves in front of me. Their wasn't enough space for a normal sized car their, much less a big ol' truck, once again I'm on my horn and I stop so he can get in. Then he let's out one last black plume of smoke, and starts weaving through traffic.
But that's just my experience being hunted. I'm making this post to ask, what's your experience being hunted, and how did you handle it?
TLDR; Big PP man doesn't like Prius, breaks numerous laws making it known.",2
"My automotive therapy
My 2008 M5, the car I was never supposed to have:  https://imgur.com/a/HScha
tl;dr at the end. 
First I apologize this is long, but it's hard to tell this story briefly. I have posted my car here once or twice but one thing I haven't really talked about is what this car means to me. I figured my story might be helpful for others going through rough times. In as short of an explanation as possible I have some severe health issues that cause me to have a headache 24/7/365. It never goes away, I never get a break though the pain does go up and down depending on various things (some of which I understand and some of which might as well be the whim of fucking temperamental unicorns as far as I can tell).  I have found some things that help over the years but mainly I'm on lots of drugs and I have a somewhat expensive medical procedure I have done every 3-4 months. I've been dealing with this for over 18 years now (I'm 36, this started at 18) and early on I never thought I'd be able to hold down a job, let alone be remotely successful. I didn't even have a definitive diagnosis until about 6 years ago, the first 12 years no one could figure out exactly what was wrong with me (which was incredibly frustrating). It's been rough, to put it lightly, and I've been through some very dark times. But through it all I've had two main things that have kept me going, my family and my love for cars. Since we're in a cars subreddit I'll focus on the latter. 
I've always loved driving and it's often been one of the few enjoyable things in my day. When I'm having a bad pain day (above a 5, below an 8 because I pretty much can't drive above an 8) being able to drive and get away from things has been a sanity saver. Outside of the stress from being in constant pain (which is its own special sort of hell) I have a lot of stress coming from finances, health insurance, family stuff and work. Through all of that one of my favorite things is driving and just enjoying the car. I can zone my brain out and not think about the pain/stress/various other shit that makes my life hell on a daily basis. I can just completely absorb myself in the experience of driving and tune everything else out for a while. For me this has been crucial to keep myself going because without it I'd probably lose my mind. In addition to that the car community as a whole has been wonderful to me over the years, both people I've become friends with in person as well as friends online (some of which I've know for 15+ years). 
I haven't owned a wide variety of cars over the years, mostly because up until the last 6-7 years I hadn't made much money so I couldn't afford much. My first two cars were both Camaros (87 V6 then a 94 Z28) and I loved that z28, I put over 60k miles on it in 3 years. I drag raced it all the time (living in Orlando there weren't a lot of other racing options) until I blew the trans and traded it for a sport bike. After that I had a few super cheap cars ($500 87 Civic, $600 Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera (blew a head gasket after 3 weeks), $2000 93 Accord) I then eventually got a decent job and bought a $12k 2001 Audi A4 that saw me through 7 years of my life. That kicked me mostly over to the European side though I still very much love American Iron. I did some minor mods towards the end (small turbo upgrade, coilovers, wheels, etc) but after putting 100k miles on it all the little stuff started to break. After I had kids (I have two girls, 2 and 5 years old) I needed something bigger and more reliable. I had recently gotten in with a growing pharmaceutical company that paid pretty well (but added a ton of stress) so I was the most financially stable I had ever been. I bought a brand new 2013 Ford Fusion trying to be the responsible dad and get something with a warranty. But the fwd and the build quality issues (this was the first 3 months of the redesign in 2013) drove me to hate the car. So I looked for something that was a similar size but more fun. That led me to either a E63, S6, M5 or CTS-V. I wanted to want the S6, being that I love Audi, but I didn't like driving it. It was a nice car but didn't feel like I hoped it would. E63 was too soft and the 2nd Gen CTS-V was still too expensive. The first M5 I test drove had me hooked (even though it was a rough example) and I started my search. I stuck with the SMG because I drive a decent amount and as much as I love a stick shift I wanted the ease of an ""auto"" for a daily driver. Honestly I love the SMG despite its flaws, I feel like it really suits the car. I eventually landed on a black 2008 M5 that was wrapped matte grey with ridiculously big wheels on it (20x11 front, 20x12 rear and rubbed badly). I bought it in Virginia Beach and got pulled over 30 minutes after buying it on my way back to Raleigh. 😂 It had illegal tint and no front plate (the cop didn't give me a ticket thankfully since I showed him I had literally just bought it and didn't live in VA), but despite the rough start it has been an awesome car. The sepang bronze interior with olive wood trim was a big reason I picked the car, it was a nice difference from the sea of dark wood with black leather cars (the most common interior I believe). I removed the matte grey wrap after a few months (it wasn't in the best shape) and drove it black for about a year before I ended up wrapping it gloss yellow. I love the color so much that I plan on painting it yellow once I get the chance. It's still my daily so that won't happen until it gets retired to weekend status. I haven't done a ton of mods, IMO it doesn't need much. A Evolve Tune, Tubi exhaust, lowering springs and wheels is pretty much it and I'm very happy with it. I've now had it over 4 years and 50k miles (122k miles on it now) and I can honestly say I've enjoyed every second in the car. It's been such a transitional car for me I don't think I can ever get rid of it. It sort of represents the mountain of crap I've had to overcome to get to where I am and it will always hold a special place in my heart because of that. 
Now the complete story of what I've been through is much, much longer with lots of gory details (including brain surgery, attempted suicide and two spinal fusions and lots of financial problems to start) but it's honestly a bit much to get into here. I don't mind sharing if anyone is interested, but this post is already way longer than I intended. I mostly wanted to share how cars have helped keep me alive/sane and how much of an impact it's had on my life.  I also wanted to show that no matter how shitty of a hand you've been dealt you can overcome it and have a decent life. Don't let anything or anyone tell you what you can or can't do. I never would have imagined I'd be where I am now, but I'm proud of myself for what I've accomplished despite the immense challenges I've had to overcome. 
tl;dr - I have been in severe pain 24/7 for over 18 years but managed to somehow be fairly successful and got a badass car that helps me keep my sanity. Driving will forever be a main form of therapy for me and helps me keep my sanity despite a fucking mountain of pain and stress.",2

"My experience with taking an exotic car around a track.
So, a few months ago my (ex) girlfriend bought me a ticket to drive a car of my choice around a racetrack near me (Pittrace raceway). I figure ill just share this with you guys in case you are thinking about doing one of these. 
I had the choice of a few cars. Unfortunately by the time I went to finalize the ticket, many of the cars were chosen over. I could only choose between an R8 and a porsche 911 turbo. (maybe the S... not sure). Looking back, I should have chosen the Turbo because my god that thing sounded like a jet engine. Completely different than any engine noise Ive heard before. 
So i chose the R8. I get to the track and learn I must purchase insurance (turns out you dont actually need to do this as your own insurance covers you). But to make things worse, I was forced to buy the insurance AND the most expensive of the insurance options because it turns out you must be 21 to drive them and I am 20. So they let me slide, but forced me to purchase the most expensive package (yeah, I probably got ripped off, but i didnt give a fuck... There was 3000+ horsepower on the other side of the tent). Total with ticket comes to $400 (150+100 for insurance) ((there was a deal for $150 that day. Not normally this cheap.))
Next, I grab a helmet, get in line, and jump in the car with an instructor. Then we are off. This happened so fast. I just wanted to look at the car, appreciate the interior and what not, but it felt very rushed, which i did not like. Anyways, we go around the first bend and he says ""PUNCH IT."" So i do. And we rocket down the straight. This R8 had an aftermarket exhaust on it, so it was insanely loud. It sounded like someone had speakers blaring right on either side of your head. 
So the way this works is the instructor says ""GO GO GO"" when you are supposed to accelerate and pinches his fingers together in front of you when you need to apply a little brake and yells ""BRAKE BRAKE BRAKE"" when you need to well... BRAKE BRAKE BRAKE. Now i went into this event thinking that im going to be way more ballsy than these other guys on the track, but once you are in these cars, you start to fear for your life. I was going about 150-160 down the straight and i couldnt keep the pedal mashed. I let up. Its one thing when you are on the highway doing 140 (not that anyone ever does) and when you are doing 150 and a corner is rapidly approaching you and you know that you must slam on the brakes and hope they bring you to a slow enough speed that you can round the bend successfully. Also, I felt like i was really going fast around the track. My head was being pulled left and right... but i knew that I wasnt pushing the car. There were professional racecar drivers ahead of the group of supercars and they were SMOKING us... in V6 mustangs. I guess it goes to show how important it is to have a good driver behind the wheel. At the very end of my final lap (of like 4-5 laps) I actually braked a bit late and put the R8 into a slide around the bend. It was quite scary as the instructor was yelling ""BRAKE BRAKE BRAKE"" and then he just got quiet and grabbed the A pillar. Now this might sound stupid, but i play a decent amount Forza, and i actually sorta knew how to countersteer. Honestly, it was probably traction control that got us straight again, but Im telling you videogames do somewhat help with this. I guess it taught me jsut enough to know what sort of to do. But the car gave you such confidence! That AWD is amazing... and ill get into how it compares to RWD in a sec.
Anyways... it ends. And i get out of an all too short race around the track. Then I see the ferrari f430. I just had to drive a Ferrari at least once. So i ask the girl working there; ""is there anyway I can drive that thing?"" She agrees for another $300. So.. since i havent technically spent any money... I fork over my own $300 and jump in the ferrari. First impressions; nothing really special. The steering wheel was larger than i expected. Thats all i remember. 
We take off. THE SOUND. It was unreal. The R8 was great... but the sound from the ferrari was like this impending doom. Thats not the right description... but it was like i could hear the engine at only 3500 rpms and i knew that there was some terrible beast sitting behind me. So i take it around the track... at a slower pace than the R8. I have only driven a few cars in my life.. and nothing impressive. But i could actually tell a HUGE difference between the R8 and 430. The 430 was so much lighter and more fun to drive. And it felt MUCH less stable. I felt like i could easily spin the 430. Its like rubbing your fingers lightly on a knife.. The r8 was so dull and i knew i could just grab it and not hurt myself. But the 430 was super sharp and i could prob kill myself if i wanted to. Thats a terrible analogy but i should be studying right now and this coat is making me sweat. So deal with it. 
Now heres the sad part. redline is 8500 on the 430. I didnt take it past 7200 the entire time other than a straight. I just coulndt push it enough for the tranny to want to downshift. It was like a hot girl that just knows shes so far out of your league.. but she lets her buy you dinner anyway even though she wont go home with you. 
So, in conclusion; the ferrari was awesome, the R8 was awesome... just less awesome. Also, I should mention that I drive a manual honda prelude... and i take pride in my ability to actually drive a manual. But i didnt touch the paddles once on these cars. I couldnt. There was too much to think about. It was so fast and powerful and everything happens so much faster than you tink and you get in this super concentrated state of mind; ""Straight, get outside, BRAKE, hit the apex, gun it to the outside of the track."" I have no experience on a track, but it took all of my effort to drive those cars and i was not thinking about the paddles. So we left it in auto. 
I reccommend one of these experiences to anyone. But know this; It is expensive for what you get. I am glad i did it, but i wish there was more. When you book it, look at the track size and how many laps. I believe they charge by number of laps (4laps=$$, 8laps=$$$) not distance. So GO TO A BIG TRACK. My track was very small. 
Anyways, sorry for the wall of text and this probably is way less interesting to you than i thought it was. And there is probably a million errors. I probably put break instead of brake in there somewhere. ",2
"Stopped car browsing for a year - here's what happened
(I just wanted to post some rough impressions of changes I saw in the car market in the last year, just to get other's opinions. I thought I would add more around that talking about my year away from browsing cars. Feel free to scroll to #3 and give me your impressions.)
So you have a desk job. You love cars. That internet browser isn't going to guide itself. You search for the enthusiasts dream: something awesome that you will, somehow, not loose money buying...even if you don't have enough for a down payment. 
You've been there. You've searched until you realized you weren't getting paid for searching for it. Searched until you felt the car market was dumb. Searched until you start thinking odd ball things are good ideas. I've searched the interwebs until I've found something so tempting, I couldn't avoid it.
But work situations change. You run out of spaces for more cars. Your girlfriend worries you will get stuck in your own traffic. Anyway, I stopped searching for cars for a year. 
Here's what I felt after a year hiatus:
1. I felt better:
  Of course, you get more real things done but something else happened. There's this feeling you get when you've been sucked into the internet, going from one thing to another, only to be shocked by your surroundings to realize that you've been watching the entire Selena Gomez youtube playlist (not me....but I've heard it can happen). You feel guilty. Eye strain for no good reason. You've wasted your most valuable resource (your time). 
  With cars, its too easy. It starts innocently with ""I wonder what a first gen NSX goes for?"" (Check eBay. Check Craigslist. Autotrader. I should check the NSX blog. The new one is out. Blog for new car reviews. Oh look, someone made a go cart out of a wheelbarrow. Hmm, how much is a shifter cart? How much is it to get a Nintendo 64 and Mario Cart?...Wait, where am I?)
2. Relief in automation:
  I set up a couple of automated searches for some of the common websites (my local craigslist, ebay, Hemmings) just to watch the values of a car I have and was thinking of selling. This was wayy easier than sporadically checking values on too many websites. Since it was easier I thought, maybe this is cheating to my 'hiatus' but maybe I should do this for a couple of bucket list cars. And I did. So I would get an occasional email, be annoyed that I got it, open it if I was still curious, and go about my day. Life. Better.
3. Car asking prices are oddly dynamic:
    All not that long ago, most car prices just slowly declined. If they were old and desirable, there would be step increases in price sometimes not even observable in the short term. Lately though, it seems that many enthusiasts cars, new or old, can have aggressive transitions in typical asking prices (10-50%). Often there seems to be no understandable reasons in these price changes. Sometimes its a reaction to viral content. Sometimes its the flavor of the day. You could say sometimes its the change in economy but that seems to take longer to change than these prices. Here are some things I have noticed after my break and then, admittedly, checking back in to car browsing. (No science here. Just looked at asking prices and wrote down first impressions. I would be interested to hear your take.)
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
DOWN
  Aston Martin DB9s, down $5-10k
  BMW M3 E92, down a tad. 
  Dodge Viper (3rd gen), down $5-10k

  Ferrari 550 were similarly up. Now down ($20k?).

"Nissan 370z horror story
I bought my 370z with 11,000 miles on it in October of 2013. The car rode exceptionally well and was exactly what I expected. In June of 2014 while driving the clutch got stuck down in a popular CSC (clutch slave cylinder) failure issue that happens with the car. The clutch gets stuck down and no longer is responsive. I am advised by the Nissan dealership to bring it in. I tell them that it sounds like the CSC issue that I have read about on the forums.
June 2014---The car has 19,4xx Miles-- Nissan Dealership---100$ in
The Nissan mechanic tells me it was that my transmission fluid needed to be changed and the charged me 100 dollars. I get into the car at the dealership press the clutch down and click/stick it doesn't come back up. Still same issue in which they tell me is now my issue not covered in warranty, I know it is thought so I contact the corporate number  and open a ticket. They said they would get back to me within 3 days. I didn't have 3 days.
June 2014---The car has 19,4xx Miles—Greenway dealership—now 225 in
When I bought the car I got a extended warranty with another company (not Nissan). I had to have my car towed to that dealership, out of pocket since it couldn't even shift into 1st. They look at it and say we would cover this but its a part that still is under factory warranty. They called up the Nissan dealership and had them tow it back and repair it by replacing the CSC. The clutch never felt the same but when I complained the Nissan mechanic said it's because it needs time to break in.
November 2014---The car has 22,1xx Miles-- Nissan Dealership---
Same issue while turning CSC failure while turning almost sent me into the side walk but luckily since it happened before I felt it coming. Nissan dealership towed and took 1 week to fix it in which they rented me a car for 2 days which I had to pay for some of it (added insurance for being under 25).  They say they replaced the master cylinder. It felt really got for the first month. Then I feel it losing pressure contact Nissan they say my car is now out of Warranty unless its for the same exact issue.
February 2015--- The car has 23,71xx Miles-- Nissan Dealership---
The Clutch failed again and they just towed the car away and I have no clue what to do.  
I contacted Nissan corporate a week after the first time because they never called me back. The guy said that person no longer worked for them and that he would look into it. I got a call a few days later they would refund the bullshit transmission fluid they charged me for. They are completely unbearable to deal with. 
I thought buying a Nissan was a good idea because I need something to get me to work and school but,  I'll probably get fired now because the same car excuse only goes so far and missing a Bio-chem test is going to cost me a letter grade. Thanks Nissan shift 2.0 must not have meant anything about being able to shift. 
Every time I speak to them they treat me like they could care less but what did I expect from an overseas company that doesn't care about fixing an obvious issue with the car. If you look up CSC failure the first thought will be how hasn't there been a recall.

So some of you might remember the [2005 Mercedes G500](https://i.imgur.com/ORJ79hG.jpg) I picked up [used last summer](https://i.imgur.com/DtJwn3Q.jpg) after a long, long, *long* search. I think I’ve posted about the [“why”](https://i.imgur.com/DhbCiF2.jpg) of this vehicle -- at least for me -- but there’s always the “how” that people ask about. 
Since I literally have all my receipts in a nice little binder, and because this has been my **favorite vehicle ever**, I thought I’d report on the cost of ownership on this capable off-roader and luxury-grocery-go-getter. It's my daily driver, and we've done a handful of medium-long car camping trips with it. 
*--Disclaimer: your used G that you run out and buy after reading this might cost more or less. There are horror stories out there, as with any vehicle.--*
I bought my G used with 109,000 on the odometer and spent $28,000, which I feel was a good deal (similar vehicles listing now ~$35K); there was an accident on its CarFax however, and while I knew it wasn’t a big deal (no frame damage and insurance bought the previous owner two new doors, which meant two new window actuators!) it was there, and there was some dice-rolling going on.
I also am fortunate in that I know (and cherish) a very good local independent Mercedes mechanic, without whom I’d surely be lost and/or broke at the dealerships here.
First the big numbers:
**Purchase price: $28,000.**
**Registration: $2,209.**
My total here to bring this car from another state into my county here in Colorado was $2,209 in registration fees. This is basically how they get their sales tax out of the deal, I suppose. My purchase involved paying off the previous owner’s note, so there was no fudging these numbers here. Not that I would, of course. Just saying. This number includes the smog inspection, which involved hooking up to the G’s computer and took five minutes.
**Fix all existing issues: $4,284.**
There were a few here, ranging from things I expected and a few I didn’t (naturally). Replacing the rear coil springs was a big one; having one break right at the second turn is actually a common thing on G’s, but being an idiot I hadn’t considered that of course you replace them both so you don’t go down the street lopsided. That was almost $1100 parts and labor by itself. My mechanic also recommended replacing the worn transmission mount, a cracked coolant expansion tank, and a seat sensor that would’ve driven me bonkers if allowed to just beep at random forever. The rear door handle was messed up and needed to be replaced. There was also a ground strap at the radiator frame that went nowhere, so we tied that up.
Add to that the basic servicing that frankly had clearly been ignored: oil and filter, wipers and washer nozzles, engine air filter, 4 new brake pads and two rotors, coolant, transmission service, service and fluid for front, rear, and center differentials, and a fuel filter. 
**Things that came up over time: $610**
Amazingly I’ve only been to the mechanic twice for unscheduled stuff. I had a drippy front end oil leak, so my guy put a new seal on the oil cooler and it went away. And I needed new plugs for the V8, which was a function of mileage. The Austrians seem to have done a good job on this thing, 100% reliable. 
**Regular service: $162**
Ah, the $162 oil change! Includes a half-hour of inspection, a new filter, and 9 quarts of Mobil 1. On the plus side, I’m expected to get it done every 7,000 miles, so I won’t bite that bullet particularly often. 
**Total outlay: ---> $35,265**
Some other numbers to think about:
**Fuel**: Premium only, and you get 13 mpg no matter what you do, unless you tow a trailer, then you get 7. 
**Depreciation**: This is a good one! I have little doubt I can get my money back on this thing pretty easily. At this point these 2002-2006 models seem pretty stable in the market, price-wise. So I will lose inflation money, figure 2% per year. Amusingly, someone lost almost $100,000 in depreciation on this thing since new, but it wasn’t me.
**Insurance:** Surprisingly not bad, in part because at the end of the day it's a 13-year-old truck. That said, a new windshield is more than $1,000, so insure accordingly. 
**Add-ons:** Roof rack, new tires, and whatever else I “have” to have next year or find at a great deal used (like the rooftop tent). These things happen, fortunately not too often. ",2
"What to do when you lose control of your car: a somewhat comprehensive list of various emergency situations, all in one
I compiled a list for myself of what to do in different situations(because I like to be prepared) and wanted to share it.  If I got anything wrong, please let me know.  If you have other tips, please share them, they could save someone's life.
1. **Hydroplaning**:
 * keep your car pointing straight
 * do NOT accelerate
 * do NOT slam on the brakes (doing either can cause your car to spin out of control)
 * FWD/RWD + ABS stay lightly on accelerator and gently steer towards open space, typically into another lane or to the side (if needed).  To avoid collision, press on brakes, but not too hard.
 * RWD - ABS ease off the acceleration and gently steer towards open space.  To avoid collision, pump brakes rapidly, but lightly
2. **Icy Road**:
 * do NOT brake (this can worsen sliding or cause a spin out)
 * turn INTO the slide - turn the front wheels in the same direction the rear end is sliding. i.e. if the rear end is sliding right, turn right. TURN IN PROPORTIONAL AMOUNT TO SLIDING and do not oversteer as this can cause the car to go into a full spin
 * be prepared for oscillation- the car will slide back and forth as you attempt to correct
 * keep your eyes on where you want to go
 * if you crash, do NOT get out of the car as there will be follow up crashes.  Your car is more durable than you are.
3. **Brake Failure** 
 * downshift to lower gear
 * NO ABS: pump brake pedal fast and hard to build up break fluid pressure.  If this doesn't work after 3-4 pumps, gradually apply parking break.  Be prepared for the car to skid
 * WITH ABS: press the brake pedal all the way to the floor, ABS should kick in (there will be vibrations and grinding noises, that's ok)
 * if breaking isn't working: put car into lowest gear and steer it in a safe direction until it comes to a complete stop
 * on the highway with no brakes: steer car at a very shallow angle against the guard rail/divider to slow down
4. **Tire Blowout**
 * do NOT brake
 * continue driving straight
 * allow the car to naturally slow down
 * at 30mph or less, steer gently off the road (steering at higher speeds can cause a spin out)
5. **Partial Tire Separation** 
 * (chunk of the tread is still attached to the tire, can cause bouncing)
 * do NOT brake
 * do NOT steer until the car has come to an almost full stop (steering while bouncing can cause you to spin out and flip)
 * pull off to the side of the road
5. **Steering Failure**
*power steering failure* will be noticed before complete failure as the steering will become heavier
 * use all your strength to turn the steering wheel towards a safe location
 * stop as soon as possible
*failed mechanical linkage* - loss of directional control
 * stop as soon as possible.  You may have to skid to a halt.  Beware of others around you
*steering pulling to one side*
 * check tire pressure
 * if tire pressure is ok, take your car to a shop to check steering
*jammed steering lock*
 * gently turn the steering wheel from side to side
 * if that doesn't work: stop, push or roll the car about 3 feet/1 meter
 * or jack up the front of the car, lifting both wheels up.  This will remove the load from the steering and unlock it
5. **If you have to stop suddenly**
 * push down on brakes as hard as possible
 * if you need to steer, you can if you have ABS
 * center wheel before releasing brakes (releasing the brake before centering can cause loss of vehicle control)
6. **Running off the road**
 * do NOT brake or over correct
 * release accelerator and allow the car to naturally slow down
 * gently steer the car back onto the road
 * break only if you're about to hit something or drive completely off the road (center wheel before releasing brake)
7. **Sudden Acceleration/Stuck Throttle**
 * if acceleration happens when pushing the brake, release the pedal
 * push the pedal to the left
 * if the vehicle isn't stopping, shift to NEUTRAL
 * press the brake as hard as you can
 * if all else fails, turn off ignition
Edit: I have removed the crash section due to the advice being for cars without airbags.  If you are wearing a seatbelt and your airbags work, you should be mostly fine.  Unless you crash into a semi and their guard rail fails.  In which case no airbag or maneuver will save you.
Remember, if you can avoid driving in dangerous conditions, do.  If you have no choice, be smart, be aware, and stay calm.
Addendum: if you are traveling with a pet, secure them. In the event of a crash, do not open windows and open doors carefully. Most crash related pet injuries and deaths result from an escaped pet being run over by oncoming traffic. 
EDIT: Formatting/spelling",2
"S5 vs C43 vs GS F vs G70 vs Q50 RS vs Giulia Ti. I've driven them all a lot, and bought one!
They're all a little different, yet close enough to compare. Here's why: New, some of these cars are much higher than others. The Giulia Ti Sport stickers for 46k, whereas the GS F stickers for $82k. How can we compare? For one, the GS F is one of the worst depreciating cars in over a decade. A 10,000-mile GS F can be had for under $50k. Lexus reliability is still there, but this is an absolute monster that's like new, and stacks up against other cars mentioned here. For anyone looking to spend around $50k (USD) for a high-performance sedan, or slightly more for a new version of a couple of these cars, I hope this helps you!  I have extensively driven these cars, own one, and tracked one multiple times. I have not driven the 340m so I cannot include feedback on that car, my apologies.  I haven't been a fan of more recent BMWs so it was not on my radar.  
&#x200B;
**2018 Audi S5 Sportback** \- Limited used quantities but they are starting to pop up. You can get CPOs (certified pre-owned with an amazing warranty and low mileage for around $50k. A well-equipped S5 configures to about $62k new.
•	**Performance/Handling/Braking:** The engine is glorious and the drivetrain is even better. AWD traction with lightning fast shifts in Sport mode, yet smooth as butter when cruising around in comfort/normal modes. The sub 5 second 0-60 is no joke. The stock exhaust gets pretty damn loud when you turn all sport settings to max. It can definitely be too loud for some. Handling is about as sterile as it gets compared to this group. The car feels planted and responsive. It's soft and forgiving enough with minimal body roll. It doesn't feel sharp however. It doesn't bite into turns like the GS F or Giulia does. Everything about this car is low fuss with a very well-engineered platform. Perhaps they decided to keep excitement at a moderate 6 when being pushed. If so, mission successful. It understeers a bit when pushed, leaning on the side of safety more than dynamics. Braking is very good and consistent with this car. Minimal dive, great pedal firmness, and they seem pretty durable with spirited driving.
•	**Infotainment/Tech:** This is why you would pick this car over the rest. The Bang and Olufsen sound system (19 speakers) is freaking ridiculous. The gauge cluster, or lack thereof when you have the Audi Virtual Cockpit, really make this car stand out as the ""Tech Enthusiast's car"". I picture drivers of this car wearing a nice suite with nerd glasses. Everything inside is sterile, just like the way it drives. Engineers would appreciate the layout and intricacies of the design. There isn't much passion here, but if you want more tech per dollar than any other car, it's either this or the Genesis G70 (more on that later).
•	**Other notes:** It's hard not to like this car. What it lacks in passion it makes up for in engineering. If you want to go fast without saying holy shit, then it's the perfect car for you. Last bit: The Sportback design kicks ass. Fold the seats down if you have a massive cargo area like a hatchback on steroids. One common complaint is the smaller than expected gas tank. Expect more trips to the gas station than normal. Lastly, Audi has an excellent dealership network.
&#x200B;
**2018 Mercedes Benz C43 AMG** \- Like Audi, gently used ones in excellent condition can be found for under 50k (2017 models). New C43s start in the high 50s but most of the ones you'll find at the dealer are in the 60s.
•	**Performance/Handling/Braking:** It's a mixed bag here. The engine sounds good, even the exhaust note from the outside. There is the typical and glorious AMG thrust when unleashing the twin-turbo V6. Somehow, it all sounds a bit synthetic and the purity you get from a traditional AMG car isn't there. Don't get me wrong, the performance is there, but it doesn't feel as authentic. Handling is where things get dicey. It's a bit jarring over bumps, yet still feels floaty. Darting from left to right reveals a wider than normal dead zone in the middle, followed by greater-than-expected body roll considered it's choppiness over certain bumps. If you set everything to comfort, the ride quality is still more than adequate, but this doesn't feel like a canyon carver. It will do great from light to light, and still fly down the highway with confidence. Brakes are great on this car is well, being both firm and consistent.
•	**Infotainment/Tech:** The interior on this car is absolutely stunning... If you like it. Some people like the C Class interior, just like some people like the Lexus front bumper. Personally, I think the interior comes across as the highest quality of the bunch. There's a bit of weight to everything, the center stack is amazing with exception to the wonderful tablet screen on top that seems to plague so many cars these days. Seats are gorgeous and comfortable. Like the S5 I haven't had any back issues over long periods of time on the highway. The infotainment system is intuitive and the premium sound system is excellent. Just prepare to add a lot of packages and options to get what you want, and what the car should have come with in the first place. There's no Audi cockpit to compare to the S5 gauge cluster, but the C43 gauges are still very attractive and serve their purpose well.
•	**Other Notes:** Honestly, I really like this car. The biggest drawback is the steering feel and suspension. I'm not a fan of the rear end styling but the front end and interior are absolutely gorgeous. I don't think you would regret driving or owning this car, but you may not want to hit the canyon roads as often as other cars on this list.  It's certainly a status symbol and offers you all the comfort and tech you'd expect from a $60,000 Mercedes.
&#x200B;
**Used 2017 Lexus GS F** \- New, this car is way overpriced. The tech is too limited and frankly Audi and BMW have a bit more to offer in a similar price range (minus the reliability). In used condition however, things get very interesting. This car sells for $82k new, but 1 year of ownership will cause this car to plummet in value. More than any other Lexus I've seen. Perhaps it's the market reacting to an overpriced car. When you look at a GS F with a Mark Levinson sound system with 10k miles at $50,000, things are a lot more interesting.
•	**Performance/Handling/Braking:** Lord oh Lord this thing is a beast. Don't let its massive size (in comparison) fool you. This V8 loves to wind out and sounds glorious doing so. It doesn’t have massive low-end torque, but the powerband is smooth and progressive. The authentic intake noise often overpowers the timid exhaust. Don’t get my wrong, the type of noise that comes out of the exhaust sounds good, it’s just too quiet. Look up GS F and RC F cars with exhaust upgrades though and you’ll really know what the potential is (it’s ridiculously loud). Low-to-mid 0-60 sprints happen every single time, with no fuss. There are no inconsistent turbo issues to worry about, it just goes like hell. It feels even more lively at highway speeds with less drop-off than you’d expect. I don’t think the other cars in this writeup have a chance once you’re off the line. Handling is surprisingly good, and the standard Torque Vectoring Differential (TVD) puts power exactly where you want it. The result is very smooth corner exit with gobs of traction for a 4000lb sedan. I’ve driven this car on multiple race tracks and I think brake fade is minimal, and even better than the RC Fs I used to track. It seems that Lexus really dialed this car in well. I could beat on this car for hours straight (I have) without any hint of power drop off or overheating. It’s so easy to drive on the track you’ll crank out fast and consistent lap times, but then have a smooth highway cruiser when you need it. Fuel efficiency is the lowest of the bunch here, but also with the highest weight, largest in size, and with the highest horsepower so that’s expected.
•	**Infotainment/Tech:** I could have written 10 pages on the performance of this car, but can only write a paragraph on the tech. It’s woefully behind its German competitors. There’s no denying that it feels outclassed in almost every way. The Mark Levinson sound system is excellent, so the sound quality is there. The interface and controls feel dated, as if the infotainment development was frozen in time since 2012-2014 interfaces. While everything works just fine, don’t expect a wow factor. The layout is excellent though, with ergonomics and functionality clearly having priority over all else. There’s no smart phone features aside from Bluetooth, and the Navigation works well but interacting with it gives me old car vibes.
•	**Other notes:** If you’re looking for the best reliability of the bunch, it’s no secret that Lexus owns that. You get great performance here, with acceptable tech, but what you get going in is exactly what you’ll have for years to come. I wouldn’t expect too many headaches with long-term ownership of this car unless you factor in dismal depreciation if you purchased new. Luckily for you, if you read this first, you would go buy a gently used one with exceptionally low mileage and save yourself $30+ thousand dollars. Do NOT buy this car new.
&#x200B;
**2019 Genesis G70** – On paper this car is as good as it gets for performance versus value, while not sacrificing modern technology with the latest bells and whistles. The 3.3L Twin-Turbo V6 is a power making machine, but fuel economy is poor compared to the Germans. Everyone, as in the media and two owners on the web, say this car is great. I live in a massive state called California so apparently there aren’t any dealers for me to see. Instead, I’d have to drive to Yuma, AZ or Las Vegas to look at the single car in inventory at the time of writing this.
•	**Performance/Handling/Braking:** Low 4-second 0-60 times and 1/4 mile times show this car can consistently break into the 12s. You can get this level of performance in the low $40s (US) which is unheard of in the Luxury segment. The car has the best handling chassis here with exception to the Alfa Romeo Giulia, but more on that later. Braking performance is excellent but apparently shows signs of overheating the pads after a few intense laps. High performance track pads would fix this with ease. The transmission seems to work really well for this car, but again I haven't been able to get my hands on it.
•	**Infotainment/Tech:** For the money, this car is the checklist over-achiever. Did you want ""X"" feature? Yeah it probably has that.  Android Auto, Apple Car Play, smart lighting features, heads-up display, active safety tech, around view monitor (parking/camera), Lexicon sound, wireless charging, adjustable driver--seat smart cushioning system, etc. Shit, I want this car now. Wait, I can't see one.
•	**Other notes**: I'm not trying to dis this car at all. Everything about this car makes it a front runner for bang for your buck in both tech and performance. It only falls short in depreciation and fuel economy. Depreciation is only a guess of course right now, but if it's in parity with prior premium product offerings from Hyundai and Genesis, I wouldn't be surprised to see this take a big hit over time. It doesn't mean it's a bad car. Hyundai Corporate is trying to make a true dealer network for premium products just like Toyota did with Lexus, Nissan with Infiniti, etc. They problem is, they made a kick ass car that got hyped into oblivion for 2018. By the time 2019 rolls around, a lot of the hype and demand will wean off a bit, hurting what should have been a successful launch. They should have waited until their dealer network was more robust before launching this car. Final thought: great car with only a couple question marks. Major fail on exposing customers to this car prematurely.
&#x200B;
**2019 Infiniti Q50 Red Sport** \- Looking at the sticker price, the Infiniti Q50 Red Sport (some refer to it as RS) is a great value. 400 horsepower with a ridiculously large fuel tank and good fuel efficiency to boot. It has great interior dimensions with a large trunk. The rear seats are not foldable though, so large items may not fit well in this car. The big kicker with Infiniti is the desperation to sell car. Look up the TrueCar value and you can expect to save anywhere from 4-7k off of sticker price, with plenty of inventory to choose from. When you can get a 400 horsepower sedan for about $46,000 with a solid Nissan motor, what's not to love? Read on...
•	**Performance/Handling/Braking:** There's no denying the engine on this car is incredible. In all honestly, it seems underrated at 400hp. It absolutely screams on the highway, with the RWD model often begging for grip at lower speeds. Luckily, AWD is available for those in cold climates or fearful of low speed wet-weather driving. So can this car have bad performance? The acceleration times are great, yet this car feels like a dog with normal driving. The transmission is awful, period. It's slow and lazy, and feels like a transmission from the early 2000s. Oh wait, it is! The transmission has been upgraded to handle a lot more torque, but it's the same core transmission as the older G37s, the FX35, etc. It's basically version 2.0 of the Jatco JR710E. Braking performance on this car still feels solid and predictable though, with smooth engagement and linear stopping power as speeds drop. Lastly, steering. If you were to hook up an Xbox controller to this car, you'd have about the same level of steering feel and driver engagement. The chassis is honestly really nice and the car exhibits minimal body roll. It just get's let down by the electronic steering system that completely removes any mechanical attachment from the steering wheel to the tires. There's no communication, and the artificial steering weight in sport mode seems overdone. It tries to feel more sporty than it is with heavy steering weight, yet you still feel nothing from the road.
•	**Infotainment/Tech**: For some reason Infiniti put two touch screens in this car, with limited utility on both. For one, they are both different in resolution, brightness, and finish. One is matte and one is glossy (Weird right?). The top is only for your navigation system that does not support Apple or Android phones. Occasional pop ups when you adjust your climate control are about all that this screen is useful for. The bottom screen isn't too bad. It's bright, but the response time and feature set of the infotainment system is poor. You can't use Car Play or Android Auto you can't plug in a flash drive with music on it. You can use the radio and XM, but if you want anything on your phone, plan on having direct access to it. This is basically a glorified Bose Bluetooth system with Nav. You can navigate to the performance menu and view stats like power output, throttle position, etc. The refresh rate is so poor that the numbers are never accurate. If you play video games, this thing literally updates at less than 1 frame per second with performance data. Don't bother.
•	Other notes: It's not a bad car. If you want outright horsepower per dollar on a new car, it's a great value (at TrueCar pricing). It's fairly quiet when you're driving but this is more of a luxury car than sports sedan. Although the interior has a lot of padding over plastic, the padding is very thin (knee support on driver's right knee is very thin). The seats however are very comfortable and supportive, with great rear seat leg room. It's a great looking car with with a strong and friendly dealer network. If you can get passed the reduced driving dynamics and limited infotainment system, you'll probably enjoy this car.
&#x200B;
**2018 Alfa Romeo Giulia Ti Sport** \- This is essentially the $46k version of the Giulia, which ranges from $38k to over $80 for the Quadrifolio edition which most people cannot afford. The 2.0T is the mainstream car, and for the money, that's what compares to the others here. So why on earth would you consider a 2.0L 4 cylinder engine over ANY of the previously mentioned bad-ass cars? If you're asking that question, it's because you haven't driven one yet.
•	**Performance/Handling/Braking:** Holy hell, this car is a blast to drive. It's about as opposite as the Infinity Q50 RS as it gets. The 2.0 engine can't keep up with the twin-turbo V6 cars on the highway, although it's not too far behind. Unlike most of the cars here, the Giulia is in a world of its own with handling dynamics and steering feel. The transmission is the finest of the bunch, with the ZF8 seeming to be tuned and programmed by the Gods. The shift logic is excellent, and Dynamic mode shifts so quickly that you feel like a baseball bat is hitting the back of your seat with every upshift. Normal mode keeps things smooth, but the shift times are still quick. The fast steering ratio of this car makes it feel closest to a track toy or go-kart, yet still exhibits excellent noise suppression on the highway. The engine is only let down by the bizarre design to ensure maximum safety over fun, even in dynamic mode. There's no way to disable traction control whether you have the performance pack or not. For some reason, Alfa Romeo limits power in first gear, which is the greatest reason it only scores a mid 5 in the 0-60 run. Once you're in second gear, the car seems to pull harder than 1st. That combined with traction control results in a predictable but unexciting 0-60 run. The thrust of the multiair 2.0 engine with 25 pounds of boost and massive paddle shifters from a certain Ferrari is a riot though, and it's hard to match the excitement this car brings on a canyon run. The other complaint is the drive-by-wire braking system, which is extremely touchy. You get used to driving it, but as your car decelerates, you need to lift off the brake pressure a bit. Otherwise the car stops abruptly and your passengers will think it's your first week driving. At least the brake fade is almost non-existent on the track, with responsive and predictable bite.
•	**Infotainment/Tech**: The 2018 Giulia is a decent upgrade when it comes to infotainment compared to the 2017 launch vehicle. Android Auto and Apple Car Play is standard now, even on the $38k base model. The sound system lacks deep bass and overall power handling. The upgraded Harmon Kardon sound system allows you to adjust mid levels, increases overall power output, and adds a small sub. It's all adequate but outclassed by all premium systems found in the other cars in this write-up. Make sure you're happy with the sound before you purchase this car. The interface is slick although there is no touchscreen. Instead you use a combination of a dial and joystick for everything. It's odd at first but you eventually get used to it. Luckily the system is very responsive which helps. The screen is nicely integrated into the dash but the black background and poor brightness may be an issue for those who tend to use the optional sunroof. Another complaint is the cup holders, which are placed so close to the front dash that two large capacity cups fight for space and often bump against or even block HVAC/seat climate buttons. Oddly, the driver side cup holder is slightly larger than the passenger side. Cubby space and the cup holders are my biggest complaint on the interior. Had they made door pockets slightly larger and pulled the main cup holders back just under an inch, it would be almost perfect. The seats are very supportive with adjustable bolstering like most of the premium trims of the previously mentioned cars.
•	**Other thoughts:** Elephant in the room: Reliability! Truth is, we have no idea how well these cars will hold up over time. The multi-air intake system is incredibly complex but provides great performance and efficiency. Most issues people complained about with this car were resolved through software updates. Only the early on 2017 production models had some odd electrical and fuel gremlins that do not seem to be present in 2018 and newer versions but time will tell. Value is another question mark. The Giulia is slower than the G70 and offers less power and interior features for the same price. The Giulia obliterates all cars mentioned here in fuel economy though, with most people getting 35mpg in Advanced Efficiency mode on the highway. That's 10 more per gallon than the G70. When you drive this car at 2/3rds, it's more fun than any other car here. It's engaging without being harsh over bumps. Most people don't track their car every day, but fuel efficiency coupled with good driving dynamics and acceptable power can still be preferred over raw numbers.  It's worth driving right after or before test driving any other vehicle here to see how it feels.
&#x200B;
**Final Thoughts**: I've driven all of these cars extensively (with exception to the G70 cough cough). Some of this is my opinion, which may or may not agree with others. They are opinions after all. I occasionally review cars and have worked with multiple car engineers in the past for development. There's a million more things I could say about most cars here but didn't want to ramble too much. In the end, I bought an Alfa Romeo Giulia Ti Sport, red with RWD and the 5-hole performance tire pack. I've had a couple software issues in the very beginning but it's been fine since the updates. If the G70 was locally available with the options I wanted at the time, I may have been driving that instead. In the end, after driving them all extensively I fell in love with it. I would have probably bought the GS F if the infotainment system wasn't so bad, as that V8 can be intoxicating. At the end of the day, if you're not racing around from stop-light to stop-light, the Giulia is a blast. It's engaging, turns plenty of heads, and I look forward to driving it any chance I get. This is after a few months of ownership and about 4,000 miles.  I think you'll be happy with most cars here, but what makes you happy can be different with each vehicle.

"Did I almost got taken for a ride?
I went to a Kia Dealership which was part of a large chain in the area.
We were getting to get a used Soul for my wife. After selecting the one we liked that had the more decent carfax history, we sat down for business.
Strike 1:
A ""Destination"" Fee, marked as ""Accessories"" in the bill. 
What was weird is that the fee was 1.3k on a 10k. That was more than 10% and I tried to figure out what the heck it was. Until I felt they were doing bait a switches to attract customers. So I was ready to stand up and leave (after 1 hour of looking and test driving). 
I said that I had to think this over lunch. I told the guy it didn't make sense, specially since its masked to sound like a delivery fee of a new vehicle. So the guy noticed we were taking off and his manager took the fee off. Just like that... At one point another finance person admitted that was purely for their profit. But its not advertised anywhere until you've made up your mind on a car.
Strike 2: 
They took the fee off so I feel like I am finally gonna get the deal I wanted on the car I wanted. But something smells fishy. 
They gave me a piece of paper saying that the total loan amount was 7k at 48 months given my beefy down payment, And therefore, the monthly payment was $240...
I kept asking for a second to try to figure out why was the loan so high before signing anymore papers. A loan like this should be under $200/mo at 5% interest. So where were they getting this numbers from??
At this point I got gaslighted they were trying to convince me that the numbers were right and that my calculations were wrong. This went for an hour and a half were they would talk to me for 2 minutes and walk away for 25 making me wait.
So I get angry, and my wife gets visibly flustered. So I tell the guy, that the numbers don't add up, period. So he takes me to the manager. 
So he starts talking about warranties, and I never asked one. He says how I should pay for the certification of the vehicle and purchase certain warranty they offered.
I very specifically ask. ""What is the cost of the warranty if added to the lump sum on the loan amount"" He says: - ""A couple thousand"". Motherfucker...
Strike 3: 
Kia's warranty is not good enough apparently. If something breaks they will deny it or even void the warranty trying to fix it. Their warranty, on the other hand would fix anything no questions asked. This was supposed to be a certified pre-owned vehicle with the remaining warranty of the original buyer. I decline, they tell me my credit is gonna go to shit and the rates of the interest will go up if I don't take the warranty. I decline, another dude walks in, and my wife says fuck this shit and walks out. 
**Tl:DR** The key point was this: They gave me a chart that clearly stated the loan amount BEFORE their warranty costs that summed to something reasonable with taxes and fees. But then when it really mattered, the monthly payments included their highest tier warranty. Therefore I wasn't asking for a 7k loan but for a 14k loan...
Is this common, is this a Kia thing? Man this kills the will we had to get a Soul",2
"Bought an E55 AMG in Southern CA and drove back to San Antonio. It was glorious.
Hey everyone, today is my second day back in the great state of Texas after picking up my new to me 2005 E55 AMG. 
For reference to my perspective, prior to this car I’ve owned (in reverse chronological order): 2011 Mustang GT 6MT, 2006 G35, 2002 Maxima 6MT, 2002 Mustang GT, and a 2000 Outback. I’m 26, so I’ve had these cars over a 10 year period. 
**My reasoning for picking up this car:** I, like many of us am a huge car fanatic with a budget that doesn’t match my desires. My wife and I also decided to start a family, and are expecting our first child in March! Furthermore, in Texas, I find that straight line speed is really the primary factor in fun driving, there just aren’t a lot of fun twisties - at least not on a daily basis or nearby. Lastly, I perform all of the work that I possibly can on my cars myself, I’ve learned a lot over the years and I did a ton of research on the E55 prior to purchasing - a key ingredient of successful ownership, that I am sure I will learn about quickly. 
**My particular car** was a *SEVEN* owner car from Hawaii with 68k miles for $19,888. I actually saw this car early in my search but turned away because of the ownership history. After realizing how difficult private sellers were (and myself, it’s not super easy doing cross state transactions privately although I know DeMuro has had a lot of success) I revisited the car. I got a reputable shop recommendation from a forum member and paid $200 for a PPI. The dealer had the valve cover gaskets replaced rather than haggling with me but otherwise got a clean bill of health. The shop was nice enough but the rotors have pretty bad grooves and wear, so I’m not sure I would recommend them in the future. Something so easy to catch wasn’t addressed and I quickly realized it braking from high speed. Otherwise everything went smoothly and the car had some key parts replaced recently: all air shocks and struts with Arnott (lifetime warranty), fuel pumps, and tires, which were huge pros for me. 
**The Drive Back:** I had two good friends of mine fly out with me for fun, and we hung out in LA for a day before leaving. We left LA around 9:15AM central time, and got into San Antonio around 3:30AM. We had some stops that weren’t as quick as we could have been. 
The E absolutely oozes with torque. It isn’t that it’s much faster than my Mustang, although on paper I think it’s a bit quicker, it’s about daily driving on the highway and how leisurely you can accelerate to pass.  Anywhere from 70mph and up this thing still puts you in your seat. It’s such a lovely experience, and it rarely needs to shift down unless you’re really hammering it. The torque in the low part of the rev range is so surprising coming from the coyote which loves being rung out. *Edit:* you do realize how big of a car it is. It definitely pushes when rushed through corners, but even conservative application of your right foot helps solve the issue. It’s not a huge concern for me as discussed in comments, twisty roads aren’t in my drives much. If they were I would have considered something else! 
It’s also incredibly comfortable, quiet, and stable at speed. This is something I’m not familiar with, although I know the Germans are obviously focused on these aspects of driving more than other manufacturers. We spent most of our drive between 90 and 100mph (speed limit 80mph on almost all of IH10) and it felt like the car was out for a nice jog turning between 27 and 2900rpm. I spent 7 hours in the back seat (and I’m Doug Demuro’s size) and felt perfectly fine. It wasn’t super comfortable but it was good. Something I noticed was just how freakin thick the B pillars are and how heavy the doors are. The build quality seems to be top notch. I know this was a Chrysler era car but I am under the impression the AMG’s were still assembled in Germany? Not sure. 
The interior has been meticulously maintained with no rips or tears in the seats. The leather is supple and has great color (albeit black). The head unit is subpar but for the era I’ll take it. I’m not too concerned with it anyways, the driving experience is the car’s high point for me. It is pretty cool it has a rear sunshade and headrests I can pop down with a button, just because. The previous owner also had nice rubber mats to help keep the carpet pristine. Seat bolstering is very good although I did not get dynamic seating, which I’m not too bothered by, I assume it’s just one less thing to break. 
The actual drive time was around 17 hours with an average speed of 80mph (we hit some big traffic jams) with just under 18mpg reported over 1,350 miles. Really I was pretty happy with the mileage given our speeds and several trips up into the triple digits. 
I plan to keep the car stock and address cooling weaknesses that these have (Texas summer will be havoc on the blower) prior to even thinking about mods. But a pulley and a tune are probably somewhere in the future - I guess “thinking about mods” is an exaggeration! 
All in all I’m really excited to finally pull the trigger on one. They’re known to be pretty reliable with the right pain points addressed and not terribly complicated to work on (although the electrical scare me). It’s a great looking and subtle cruise missile with some class and I plan to keep it for years to come. I don’t have great pics yet but here are a few I took: [Pics](https://imgur.com/gallery/AyKJuHM)",2
"Just spent two days installing driver mod from Ford Performance
They say the driver mod is the best thing you can do to make your car faster, and thanks to Ford Performance I was able to do just that this week. I’ve never been on a track or autocross before. For those that don’t know, one day of training is complimentary - free - with the purchase of Ford Performance vehicles. The specific ones are the Fiesta and Focus ST, GT350, Raptor, and in my case the Focus RS. You foot your own bill to their facility at the Utah Motorsports Campus in Tooele, Utah and spend a day in school supplied, track prepped versions of the same car learning to drive.
https://i.imgur.com/57cXO8T.jpg
The RS they run at the school is basically stock but has extra cooling to survive the rigors of track duty. Unfortunately the kits are custom and they have not produced a commercial version. They are otherwise the same, right down to the OE Pilot Super Sports. This is fantastic, because it gives you a safe environment to take these cars up to and beyond the limit in a configuration that is identical to what comes off the factory floor.
https://i.imgur.com/ObY298k.jpg
The day starts off with a short classroom session on the usual basics (track rules, apexes and racing lines, etc) before everyone goes out in vans and sees the East track corner by corner with tips on each one. They use cones to mark the entry, apex, and exit points of every corner so you have good visual reference points about where you’re trying to go. Next is a 20 minute lead-follow session in groups of 3-4 cars with people rotating places, which gives you a chance to find a pace and begin exploring the cars. From there you get a 20 minute open session with an instructor ride-along for half. Lastly you get to ride with an instructor at full tilt, which really drives home just how slow you are.
https://i.imgur.com/HxxytYa.jpg
After lunch, the RS crowd breaks into groups for exercises on cornering, drive modes, and yes, drifting. New for this year is the Drift Stick accessory, which is a magical electronic analog to a hydraulic handbrake. It’s weird! Lastly they take you out for a timed “urban cross” which is just a densely coned autocross with a Ken Block styled figure eight in the middle. I would’ve done well if not for my cone murder. Everyone gets a couple keepsakes at the end, the big one being the *real* Brembo caliper trophy.
https://i.imgur.com/pFEXnAu.jpg
Now, participants can optionally pay for a second day of regular Ford Performance Racing School, which is a $1500 upgrade. While the owner program is a little more about all the things your car can do, the FPRS program is a short but serious race training program. Everyone gets a track prepped Mustang GT for the day. The day opens with classroom instruction again, followed by a couple parade laps of the West track. After that you’re pulled away for exercises on oversteer/understeer, threshold braking/heel-toe, and cornering through increasing and decreasing radius turns.
https://i.imgur.com/7xbPuUO.jpg
That takes you up to lunch, with another classroom session before you’re let loose on the track. And then at long last, it’s time to hit the road for real. There are three twenty minute sessions intercut with classroom, much like the RS. First lead-follow, then open/ride-along, and finally full open session. Whether it was my increasing comfort being on a track or just the nature of the school, these were fairly intense high speed sessions pushing hard. The RS tolerates and bad driving and eases your mistakes; the Mustang expects you to have real finesse. You can kinda get by on the East track without heel-toe, but I was dying on the West track without it and quickly made it a priority to get it right before hot lapping. It feels hideously unnatural at first, but nailing that shift *without* compromising your braking zones or turn-in is so very sweet.
https://i.imgur.com/0E7p0Kn.jpg
https://i.imgur.com/UZI72tf.jpg
In a flash, the second day is over. There’s some more gift bag goodness, and a small shop for merchandise out front. I feel like a completely different driver than when I came in. Sure I’ve spent some time in various well regarded sim games and I’m halfway decent at finding the line and zones, but no sim I’ve ever tried is a substitute for interacting directly with the car and feeling what all four contact patches are doing at any given time. Games definitely gave me a leg up, as I felt much more comfortable much more quickly than most of the other students, who generally didn’t have racing experience. The real car forces you to be much better than the sim, though. It was money well spent, and without voiding my warranty at that.
10/10 would install again.",2

"The Sacred Bond between Driver and Car
**TL;DR - She gave up on me. She let me down. It's like she ran off and deserted me**
I've had my car, a 2001 Acura CL Type-S for just over 10 years now. Purchased it with just under 70k miles in 2007 and I've since driven it fairly hard for ten glorious, fun, problem free years. Other than routine maintenance and a list of go-faster/handle-better parts, the car has needed absolutely nothing. Never left me stranded, never asked for anything other than the standard fluid changes, brakes, and tires. Hit 236k miles without even a hiccup.
 
&nbsp;
               
Last week, the driver's window motor went out. Caught me by surprise, because the window fell down into the door (luckily it didn't break). No biggie. A $60 part and an hour of quick work later, she was back in business.
 
&nbsp;
 
I love the car. Still do. But, it was time for a change. Wanted something with 4 doors and a little more power. I spent the past 6 months searching for a 2nd Gen CTS-V and finally found the perfect one a couple of weeks ago. Flew across the country, checked it out and arranged for transportation back to the great state of Texas. The V is going to be delivered about 3 hours from now, and I can't wait.
 
&nbsp;
 
The plan was to keep the Acura as a second car... because selling something so reliable and good to me would be stupid. Well, the Acura is not happy about this. Not at all. She very clearly told me to go fuck myself by grenading the transmission on my morning commute today. Literally hours before the new car gets here. HOURS BEFORE THE NEW CAR GETS HERE! If it was a problematic car, I'd chalk it up to coincidence, but that's not the case. There's no way this is a coincidence. This could have happened over any of the 170k miles I've driven her during the past decade. She knew she was about to be replaced and decided to go out on her own terms.
 
&nbsp;
 
Lesson learned from this? Next time if I'm planning on replacing a car, I'll make sure the car doesn't find out.",2
"Car & Driver 2019 10Best ""Inadequacies:"" Quick blurbs on the cars that didn't make the 10Best list this year
In the print edition of Car & Driver, January, 2019, they dove into the year's 10Best cars list. They also had a small section in the margins of the 10Best feature called ""Inadequacies."" In this section, they gave a quote for each car that was up for 10Best contention, but didn't make it, briefly summarizing its shortcomings. Lots of interesting insight, if you ask me! Remember that Car & Driver has a full set of tests they run to select their 10Best cars, many of them on a track, so it's not just a group of editors sitting in a room and picking which ones they like best. So, here they are:
* **Audi A6:** ""Way more luxury than sport here.""
* **Audi A7:** ""It's like Audi tried to make a Tesla Model S out of a gas-powered car. Needs more sound and fury. But I guess that's what the S7 is for.""
* **Audi RS5:** ""The RS5 used to have a howling V-8 and gobs of personality. This one feels sedate in comparison.""
* **BMW i3s:** ""Even in its marginally sportier guise, the BMW i3 continues to be as far as you can get from the experience of driving a car while still driving a car.""
* **BMW 640i xDrive GT:** ""Drives like a hockey arena.""
* **Buick Regal GS:** ""The name vastly oversells its performance.""
* **Buick Regal TourX:** ""Less than the sum of its parts, attractive though they are.""
* **Honda Clarity PHEV:** ""As far as the effort to remove all sensory traces of dynamic motivational activity under the hood goes, this thing is a champ. The ultimate anodyne driving experience.""
* **Honda Insight:** ""What to buy when you really want a Prius but can't bear to look at one.""
* **Hyundai Accent:** ""There's an awful lot of competence here for the money. Not necessarily much joy but an awful lot of competence.""
* **Hyundai Veloster:** ""The N splits the difference between a VW GTI and a Civic Type R without being better than either. And like all Velosters, this one is still burdened by its economy-car ethos and weird design."" 
* **Jaguar XF Sportbrake:** ""It's handsome as all get-out, but the interior isn't as nice as it should be, the powertrain is not as refined as it should be, and the chassis isn't as fun as it should be.""
* **Kia Forte:** ""Manages the strange trick of looking cheaper than it actually is.""
* **Lexus ES/Hybrid:** ""Was the dashboard designed to win a bet? It is more terraformed than styled, with various vintages of switchgear and instruments.""
* **Lexus LS:** ""I'm startled by how removed from the driving experience this car has become. Like changing lanes from your bed.""
* **Mazda 6 2.5T:** ""Very refined but doesn't feel sharp. This has me worried that Mazda is starting to walk away from sportiness in favor of luxury.""
* **Mercedes-Benz C-Class:** ""Much improved but still not as satisfying as the E-class.""
* **Mercedes-Benz CLS-Class:** ""No longer better looking or handier than the E-class, so I fail to see the point.""
* **Nissan Altima:** ""Rental-car desk agents should see a dramatic decrease in arguments with disgruntled customers.""
* **Nissan Leaf:** ""A car that is crying out for automation to remove the irksome requirement to operate it.""
* **Porsche Panamera:** ""Breaks Porsche's rule of functional design. Who thought that air vents that can have their direction changed only through a touchscreen was a good idea?""
* **Subaru WRX STI Type RA:** ""A relic from Subaru's Brutalist period, it's the antithesis of what 96 percent of its customer base values: It's loud, harsh, and busy. It's also incredibly fun, especially on gravel.""
* **Toyota Avalon/Hybrid:** ""It exists for cruising the mega-slab, but there are no interstates on the 10Best loop.""
* **Toyota Corolla Hatchback:** ""Good enough to make the 10Best list -- in 2008.""
* **Volkswagen Jetta:** ""If the Golf is the sibling that lives in the suburbs, pulling down good scratch and maxing out its 401(k), the Jetta is the poor relation sheltering under a cardboard box at the bus station.""
To clarify, there were a couple other vehicles that didn't make the list, but were close enough that their acknowledgements were less... mean. The **Alfa Romeo Giulia Quadrifoglio** was well-loved by nearly everyone, but had so many issues that needed to be serviced when they had one long term, it was basically out of the running. The **Tesla Model 3 Performance** did very well too, but since it starts at nearly $80k, it was very hard to justify its value vs competitors. The **Audi RS3** was on the 10Best list last year, but this year there was no way they were picking it over the M2 Competition, which has better performance *and* an improved ride vs its non-Competition predecessor, leaving C&D to look at the RS3 less as a threat and more as ""a really expensive, really powerful VW Golf with a really small trunk."" Harsh words. The **Kia Stinger** GT almost made the list last year, and the Kia Stinger 2.0T almost made it this year, but the Genesis G70 better captured the hearts of the C&D editors. The **Camaro** was bumped from the list by the newly-refreshed Mustang, not necessarily because the Mustang is the clear winner, but because Chevy's 2019 ""refresh"" of the Camaro gave each trim a new grille and not much else, preserving issues with livability in the cabin in the name of exterior design. And finally, Dodge brought some **Challengers** to the 10Best competition, for the third time in five years, but all they've done each time was add more power to a car that hasn't been fully redesigned in about 10 years.
Finally, here's a reminder of the 10 cars that *did* win this year:
* BMW M2 Competition
* Chevrolet Corvette Grand Sport/Z06
* Ford Mustang GT/Bullitt
* Genesis G70
* Honda Accord
* Honda Civic Sport/Si/Type R
* Mazda MX-5 Miata/RF
* Mercedes-Benz E450/AMG E53
* Porsche 718 Boxster/Cayman
* Volkswagen Golf Family",2
"Tell me about American cars
I live in Northern Europe. It's very rare to see American cars here except for Fords. And by American, I don't mean that somewhere somehow the brand is owned by an American company. I'm talking actual American cars, like a GM, Buick, Lotus (?) and tons of other brands I might not even have heard about.
Tell me about your cars! What is the equivalent to a VW, a reliable family car that almost never breaks down? And Mercedes, what the American equivalence to a luxury German car? How about Toyota, are there American small cars with amazing fuel efficiency, which one? I'm very curious! :)",2
"Bought my first car with V8 & Manual Transmission last week
First things first: [Imgur album](https://imgur.com/a/sBPEIoN)
Also, **tl;dr:** Rode in Corvette. Decided I wanted my own. Used my incentives from working for GM to pick up my own Grand Sport 1LT. 12/10 would do again.
**Background:** A friend of mine at work was looking for a new cars when the lease on his Camaro SS was up, and I happened to come across some lease deals being advertised for Corvettes for \~$400/month along with a CTS\-V being offered at about $600/month \(granted that was with 10k down\). Fast forward a few days, and he picked up a brand new Corvette Grand Sport 1LT on a 27 month lease. Rode back from lunch with him one day, and even though it was a short ride, I was sold. I wanted one of my own. I had been looking into cars to replace my Subaru with when the lease was up in January anyways. I test drove a CPO BMW 335i xDrive with a 6 speed manual when I was home not long ago planning to go that route. But I wasn't sure that I wanted to spend 5\-6 years \(to keep payments where I wanted\) paying for a used BMW. It also doesn't help that I inevitably want a new car every few weeks. I started looking into leasing a new BMW instead. The payment would have been higher, but with included maintenance, a full warranty, and being able to walk away after 3 years without worry about being upside down, it was a decent option. However, a lease payment would have been around $610/month for one optioned the way I wanted with $4500 down.
I conveniently just transitioned from being a contract employee to a direct employee at GM \(engineering\) which means I now qualify for the full employee discount along with other incentives and also got a pretty good pay bump. A couple of insurance quotes and lease quotes later, I was driving home in a brand new 2018 Corvette Grand Sport 1LT. There aren't many options on the car \- red brake calipers, red seat belts, carbon flash badges, black wheels with the red stripe, and the battery protection package \(aka charger\). I'll still have to replace the Subaru in January so I have a car for bad weather driving, but I'll likely end up going for a cheap employee lease deal on something like an Equinox/Terrain or a Silverado. It's not uncommon to see 24 month leases advertised at \<$100 per month here.
**I regret nothing.** I test drove it with 4 miles on the odometer. It was at 9 miles when we got back to the dealership, and it was up to 10 miles when I took delivery since they have to take it off\-site to fuel it up with premium for delivery. I'm up to about 325 miles so far from driving it this week.
This car is absolutely amazing! It's unlike anything I'd ever driven before. My first car was a 2005 Mazda 6i which was replaced by a 2008 Subaru Legacy 2.5i. That was eventually replaced with a 2016 Subaru Legacy 3.6R Limited. Other than those, the fastest/most powerful car I'd driven more than a few feet \(used to work as a valet attendant\) was probably my friends tuned STI or his new tuned 335i. I don't know which one was more powerful \- probably the STI since it was tuned on E85 \(vs 91 octane for the BMW\). Still, it's just a night and day difference. This car just feels like it never wants to stop pulling. I haven't been able to go too crazy yet. For the break\-in period, the dealer said to keep it under 3500rpm for the first 500 miles. That's easier said than done though. The redline on the tachometer starts at 3500rpm right now. Actual redline is 4500rpm. I've been doing my best to go no higher than 4000rpm though, but I've hit probably 4500\-5000 twice. At 500 miles, the odometer should change to its normal redline and I should be good to go after I get the first oil change done.
Also, the active rev matching is fantastic. I know how to drive a manual, but I've never driven one regularly enough to say I'm truly skilled at it. The rev matching works wonderfully. The shifter feel is also fantastic. The shifter doesn't really feel sloppy at all. Still need to get used to there being a 7th gear though, I've accidentally gone from 6th back down to 5th instead of 7th a couple of times, and it takes some getting used to in general to know where the gears are. I have a smile on my face every time I drive this thing! It is definitely going to take some getting used to as well in a lot of regards. I've spun the tires a few times, and it was purely accidental. A couple of times were from hitting the gas too soon when going through a turn. Another time was just hitting the gas too hard when accelerating from a slow speed. It's wild. I'm not used to being able to do anything like that. But at the end of the day, I'm incredibly satisfied with this car! The next 39 months should be amazing.",2
"Last time you guys read my Review on the Lexus LFA, and now...the Lamborghini Huracan
Hello Everyone, last time I posted about me driving the Lexus LFA; there was a great response from you all from it, and I thank you for that, I was truly humbled by the response I got. I recently got to drive another sweet car, so I thought I’d write about it. 
**Summary at the bottom and Link to a picture of me with the car.**
Sadly I don’t have a video of me driving the Lamborghini Huracan (It didn’t have recording equipment in it and I didn’t have a co-pilot), but I do have a picture of me with the car, I hope this suffices. As some of you may remember, I’m a racing instructor and teach people to drive Super Cars for a living. This is why I get the opportunity to drive many cars, so…I’d like to share with you my experiences. 
Again, this time I’ll try and comment on things you don’t normally read or see in main stream Car media, and I’ll go chronologically as I remember them. I like to make bullet points, I think it makes it easier to read because Reddit’s Line Breaks are small.  
**Exterior and Interior**
* First thing I notice is the shape of the vehicle, it’s very small in person. The engine cover is made of metal and painted matte black, this surprised me, I expected some kind of composite.
* The Keys to the Huracan and Aventador are disappointing. They share the same exact key fob as an Audi A4; its absolutely asinine and I don’t understand Lamborghini’s logic behind this, cars this expensive should have amazingly beautiful, unique keys.
* When you open the door to the Huracan, you press the front most portion of the handle in, and the back most portion then rotates outward much like a GTR or Aston Martin door handle. The handle is plastic and feels like a skinny television remote, I wish it were made of metal. When you buy a $300,000 car, every surface you touch should be amazing (IMO)
* The interior is a huge upgrade from the ancient Gallardo, the interior is of higher quality and it has better refinement of the cabin real estate. The cabin is quite nice, the one thing that surprised me was the lack of Infotainment Screen in the center dash, they since have moved the infotainment screen to the dash behind the steering wheel, so there is not much for the passenger to focus on when looking at the dash, this is interesting to me.
* In the Lamborghini Gallardo, the paddle shifters were small, only about an inch long, and were static, they didn’t move with your hands. This design was awful and often led to drivers hitting the windshield wipers while driving. Lamborghini has finally given the huracan a proper set of paddles that are large, made of fine feeling metal, and give a satisfying clunk on shift (Not as satisfying as the Lexus LFA’s though)
**The Drive**
* When you start the car, you lift a huge red cover over the start button which is a **Vast** improvement over the Aventador starter cover. The aventador starter cover was this little wimpy plastic flap that covered the start button. The Huracan has a proper, large, solid toggle that covers the start button. On start up you get a jolt to 3000 rpm and a few crackles as the rpm Falls to 1000, its glorious, exactly how a Lamborghini should start. 
* The Huracan has an urgency that wasn’t there with the Gallardo; It accelerates as hard as an aventador but with a smoother power delivery, its better. At full throttle the car sounds more aggressive than any of the past Gallardos. Lamborghini has given the Huracan fairly short gearing which lets the car climb through the revs quicker than the Gallardo. Lamborghini V10 motors have a distinct metallic resonance as the RPMs climb, its unique, the Huracan adds refinement to this sound, its no longer wobbling resonance as in the gallardo but now humm as it pulses through the Revs, the engine is better, it sounds better, it sounds tighter. On overrun it has lots of crackles and pops, from the inside its subtle and you only hear it if you’re waiting for it. They’ve done a good job with the noise. 
* There is something interesting with the gas pedal, when you press the gas pedal all the way down, it hits the ground, but then if you press it harder, there a button at the bottom. You feel the pedal touch passed the initial contact point and this tells the car to downshift if you’re in a high gear, It feels unauthentic, when the Gas Pedal hits the floor, that should be it…the Floor. If I want a downshift I’ll click the paddle myself, the car shouldn’t make that decision for me. 
* The shifts… FINALLY, Lamborhini has made an amazing Gearbox. The gallardo had a terribly rough and out-dated gearbox that would slam the gears into place. Finally Lamborghini has made a gearbox as good as the Ferrari 458 italia. Each shift is seamless, you flick the paddle and without even a shudder you’re a gear up or down, its fantastic, Not to mention the sound of the downshift, smooth and and refined it snaps into lower gears.
* The brakes…an interesting thing. Hard on the brakes into the corner and theres about half inch of pedal travel before the brakes bite, and the the rest of the brake pedal is very long. This can give good brake modulation with more time in this car, but intuitively the brakes feel delayed and clumsy, I don’t like the brakes in this car, Lamborghini has left a lot of improvement here for future models.
* The suspension is another…improvement that could be made. There is a lot of suspension movement, the soft suspension given to this entry level huracan is soft and soaks up a lot of bumps on street roads, but it’s not great for the track. This soft suspension sends the front of the car diving into the corners with great initial bite from the front tires, then it rebounds mid corner lifting weight off the front wheels and causes understeer. If you give gas during this understeer and then quickly lift off the gas, you’ll get a nice slide which can make for a fun driving experience, but it doesn’t make for a fast lap time, just a bit of tire smoke :P
**Summary:**
Huracan is an amazing package. It brings the finesse of a Ferrari 458 italia to the Lamborghini brand. Its lightning fast upshifts, quality interior, and smooth motor brings a swiss-made feel to the before brutish nature of the past Gallardos. BUT you can tell that Lamborghini has left a lot of room for improvement, the brakes, suspension, and aggression have all been toned down for the first Huracan. Lamborghini knows the Huracan is going to be in their Model Line-up for a long time to come, and they’ve left some meat on the bone. Honestly, a later model, rear wheel drive Huracan might take the cake over the Ferrari 458 italia for me, I love it.

"9 Months Focus RS ownershop update
So i have had my Rs for 9 months and decided to do a **ownership** experience.
Car was bought brand new in September last year. Fell in love straight away, the way to gets upto speed, the handling and the pops from the exhaust.
**Ride Quality :**
The ride is more bearable then i thought. Suspension is stiff and you do feel every imperfection on the road but its not a hard bumpy ride. Its pretty composed. Would i change the suspension? nope.
**Handling :**
Havent been to a track yet but the car handles so well. Its satisfying around twisty corner as car does what you want it to do, the front has lots of grip and back rotates perfectly. Have to be careful because the back does come around if you push it to hard. Compared to my Toyburu 86, Rs is a lot more stable but thats what you expect from AWD. It does get you excited and bumps up your heart rate around twisty roads.
**Power :**
Thinking about getting a little more power out of the car. Launch control is nice but i was expecting a bit more. You just dont get a kick which glues you to the seat when using launch control. In 2nd gear the car does pull hard, you can feel the turbo pushing you back in your seat as the car accelerates. Just wish the launch control was more dramatic.
There is some torque steer and car does behave differently when accelerating with different modes. In race made the car does have torque steer up the front. In Drift mode you can feel the car trying to break traction in the rear, does feel like a RWD car when accelerating in drift mode.
I usually drive in sport mode.
**Other stuff :**
Reliability wise, no major or big issues to report. Tire pressure sensor only worked once. Now when my pressure is low i dont get a warning. Connecting the phone to the cars headunit sometimes dosent work either with bluetooth or cable.
When using cruise control at 50kph , the car for 1-2 second would bog down for some reason. hasnt happened recently.
No recall on my VIN yet. 2017.5 model year, No engine issues encountered so far. 87xxKM done so far.

"2016 Corvette: What a Car
So yesterday my car (1990 Volvo 240 Wagon) died on the way to work.  As part of getting my car towed I got a free rental car.  While at the rental place they had some sport cars up front and I figured... why not.  They had the 2016 Mustang Convertible GT and that is what I had wanted to drive as I figured it was the more reasonable of the three.  Booked.   Damn.   So then it was either the 2015 Porsche Boxster Convertible or the 2016 Corvette.    Corvette it was!  
Earlier this year I took a similar opportunity to drive a Maserati Ghibli and was quite impressed at the speed and handling of that car.   But this Corvette was something else!    The corvette was definitely faster and more impressive looking while the Maserati was wayyyy more comfortable.   
I did about 200 miles of driving last night in the Corvette and I have to say that that was one of the most visceral car experiences I have ever had.  The first time I pulled it out of my driveway (onto a 50mph street) I tried to break loose the tires.  But nope. The car sort of dug in, gripped the road, and rocketed its way in the direction I steered it.   
Sitting at a stop light you can hear the clickity clack of the engine internals (valve rockers?) running a long.  But as soon as you touch that throttle it has a guttural feeling of literally a beast waiting to be uncaged.    Once unleashed that car had the power and then some.  
At one point a rice rocket pulled up along side me and while definitely tuned up once I had the opportunity and clear road  a punch with my foot and he was quickly in my dust.  And the best part was that I could clearly see the speed and g force not just on the dash but also on a beautiful heads up display that was the perfect blend of information and not too bright as to be distracting.   With desert techno beats pulsating and the wind in my hair from the open top a HUGE smile came across my face.    
This car was hands down the best car I have ever driven.  I regularly drive lots of brand new production cars as rentals.  I used to really enjoy the Fords the best.  But then drove a 2015 Impala and Malibu and then also a Cadillac.  Chevy has upped its game.  And while the Corvette has always been its flagship what I felt in driving that car was literally the epitome of every car driving experience I have ever had.   The 2015 Mustang impressed me.  The Corvette blew me away.  
Today... I am taking the ladies in my life out for a ride here shortly and then taking it back to the shed to ride another day.   My flirtation with speed, flash, and design at an end.   And the experience of driving that car on the open highway for just one day*?   Worth every penny.

"""I think I have rod knock on my 2017 mustang"" conclusions
Hey friends, so awhile back I had 2 threads detailing what happened with my car. Gonna spare you the time, tl;dr, I took a turn, accelerated to about 40-50 mph, slowed down to turn into a neighborhood and heard my car knocking like crazy.
Well this happened back in January. I brought the car in via truck bed tow to the dealership and dropped it off on the 29th of January. They tore down my engine and drained the oil, finding metallic pieces in the oil and scoring in the cylinder walls. Upon further inspection, they found a cracked rod bearing. I wish they took pictures for me, but for now I'll have to take their word on everything. They said the oil level and quality was normal and still good. It had only been 5000 miles since my last oil change.
I didnt have a tune on it, so theyre unsure of what happened. Initially they told me theyre going to scan the computer in the car to see if I had been beating the shit out of it and if it had a tune, which i said was fine. 
They ended up doing just a short block replacement, not the full long block. Normally, I wouldn't be happy about this, but I'm getting rid of the car soon anyway. More on that in a second.
The dealership had my car for 42 days (January 29- march 12th) and throughout the whole time did not make any effort to contact me or give me updates about my car. I didnt even get a loaner from them until 14 days in. When i got my car back, there are very noticeable fingernail length paint chips on my hood which weren't present before. I immediately noticed them after they took it out for me. I asked if they could do anything for me considering they had my car for 6 weeks and it was not treated well while in their care. They said I got a free oil change with the short block replacement, as in the oil inside the car now is my free oil. Thats some r/technicallythetruth shit right there hahaha. 
Well, its over, I have my car back and the dealership is awful. My service advisor who they assigned to me ended up quitting while my paperwork was under her care, so they had to scramble and print new things for me for 30 minutes. Because of this, I'll be lemon lawing my car. In VA, it has to be out of service in the dealerships care for 30 or more days. Its not worth taking the diminished value hit after the engine replacement. 
Sorry for the formatting and everything, im on mobile and figured I'd type this up real quick on my break.",2
"This week I test drove a Kia Stinger GT and a Tesla Model 3...
I test drove the Kia Stinger GT with RWD on Sunday. I got the the Kia dealership and was in a Stinger within 2 minutes. I took a test drive and fell in love, I got to take it around the swooping autoplex roads and then 3 exits on the highway. The sales guy was an older no sales pressure guy. Showed me all the options in every trim and had answers for everything. 
I got home and I was still smiling. I want to buy, but want more of a down payment. 
With the Tesla Model 3 coming out with a similar priced model soon I went to the Tesla store in Scottsdale to try it after work today. I arrived with my wife and was told they were not doing test drives. I told them I tried to schedule online and it told to go into the store. They realized I wasn't window shopping and let me try a 3 they had in the garage, with AWD. I could only drive it around Old Town Scottsdale, mostly in traffic, although I had 1 opportunity to floor it. That was fun, but the car was very heavy and had no driving feedback. 
Overall I liked the Kia waaaay more than the Tesla. I'm looking forward to buying one later this year. 
Also in every Kia/Hyundai praise thread someone calls it suspicious, but I swear I'm a regular person.
Edit: After sleeping on it I had some more thoughts. 
They only let me drive it on surface streets so I don't think I can fairly compare it to the Stinger which I got to hoon on. People overblow only having the tablet as a visual, I like it, but I wish there were more buttons to press, specifically for the radio and maybe a toggle for drive mode, the plus side is if they want to add more modes they just do a software push. It felt pretty similar in size to a Civic, but you could tell it was much heavier. The brakes were not as responsive as I was expecting them to be. I agree with Ars Technica, the steering wheel is cheap feeling. I think it is fun to drive, but I'm so accustomed to a petrol vehicle I don't think I was driving it in the way necessary to make it ""fun"". I'm not accustomed to regenerative braking(which I had on the low mode) and I think didn't counter it well enough. 
The main pluses of the Tesla are HOV lane access and supposedly low maintenance. Downside would be AZ has a high yearly registration fee for EVs, meaning maintenance of the Stinger would not be much more price wise. 
The Stinger may weight a similar amount, but it is a much larger vehicle so it isn't as ""dense"" feeling, which makes it feel lighter. It was easy to break the tires out into a small amount of oversteer on purpose and maintain control, which I was unable to try in a AWD Model 3. The steering wheel, drive mode selector, and Android Auto were the 3 main things on the interior of the Stinger that stood out to me. The seats were low enough to feel sporty for me, while maintain comfort. 
I'm going to need a few weeks to think on it honestly. Stinger was much better driver's car in my test drives, the seats and steering wheel were tiers above the Tesla, and I just am used to how petrol cars accelerate and don't regenerative brake; but the more I think about it HOV access seems nice and I don't want not having it to haunt me.

"I replaced my deceased E92 M3
Leaving the title empty because I want to see what car the mods tag it with. Long post follows as I reviewed some cars.
End of June, an idiot driver decided to make a left turn from a side street in front of me on a highway, giving me less than 50 ft to brake. My old E92 took the brunt of the blow, and I walked out with a sprained tailbone and some bruises and scrapes. Seeing the empty space in the garage coming home from the hospital was depressing. It was particularly devastating when I got to the tow yard, saw the remains and all the electronics fired up like it wanted to go for another drive. May it rest in peace: https://imgur.com/a/RcWCfmk
So I decided to do some test driving. Here are my thoughts on the cars I drove, and I should probably flame suit up, as some of the cars are really loved among enthusiasts.
M2: I just couldn't understand why it was so raved about, maybe on a track it’s better. It will kick the back out a bit in most cases, but it simply reminded me of a slightly pumped up M235. The interior is pretty bad (the Mustang felt nicer), and the suspension is set absurdly stiff. Coupled with the short wheelbase (why it wants to rotate admittedly), on rough roads it felt like it was trying to break your spine. This was an N55 car, it sounded nice, but wasn’t particularly exciting to push. Was much happier in the M4
M4: The M4 felt like a much better built product, and the engine is positively ballistic. I liked it much more than the first time I drove one. The engine was one of my biggest issues with the car, however. Yes, it’s stupid fast even stock, but it just didn’t feel that rewarding to push, it’s speed for the sake of speed. Also, it sounds god-awful and seems both simultaneously proud and embarrassed of that fact. Like a 16 year who just lopped the muffler off their Civic, and thinks it sounds so awesome. But then they pump in a fairly nice sound through the speakers to mask it. Steering on both was okay, not fantastic, but not horrid and artificial feeling. I lost all interest in the car once I hopped back in my wagon, and decided the feeling I really liked from the engine was simply a result of turbocharging. This also made me really considering going big turbo on the wagon instead… The other problem was how much the electronics were trying to take over the experience. The auto-revmatch was pissing me off (I know you can disable it by killing all aids, but still) and the interior sound is all faked. The E92 felt wired directly to me, the F82 felt wired to a computer and then to me.
718 Boxster: The Boxster was nice to drive. Was a town drive, but still felt pretty sharp and like I was actually driving a car. The engine killed it, it just felt so bland, like any other turbo engine. Powerful and quick, but bland. Maybe a 981 would be more my speed, but the beauty of the other cars is that they are way more usable, meaning you have more opportunities to drive and enjoy them. I also was wanting more power from my E92, and the 981 wouldn’t scratch that itch easily.
GT350: I’ve driven the GT350 twice in the past few months. I enjoyed it the first time in a city/highway situation. The noise was amazing, brakes were brutal, shifter was rifle-bolt accurate. It did feel a little slow when I got to do a light launch onto the freeway, but more concerning was the smell of burning oil and smoke coming out of the hood after I did that. I drove another one the day after driving the M4, this time in a backroad situation. It still sounded amazing, but a little overdone. I don’t know why the burble overrun needs to go on for what seemed like 3-5 seconds, it’s just so fake. With the exhaust in quiet mode, it’s not actually that fantastic. Also, you may have to loop the seatbelt through the seat strap, as it kept slowly riding up my neck like it wanted to slice my throat. When I started to throw it around the corners, this is where I fell out of love with it. I know it’s only 2-300 pounds heavier than the E92, but it feels noticeably heavier, less agile and less playful. Steering was completely dead when I threw it in, no weight or feeling coming back at all. Then on a tight section of road, I realized how huge it actually it is. Like piloting an F150 down the road. I also found a nice, empty, straight stretch of road. Came to a stop, and did another light launch. It still didn’t feel that fast, though it is extremely visceral. It’s got to be the length of the gearing that kills the speed. I also smelled oil again after doing that, even though it was a different car. I think the long gearing screws it over on the street. And I know people who buy them don’t care much about this, but it just doesn’t feel well put together or special on the inside. The interior still felt like a rental Mustang that someone bolted some go faster bits in and slapped a plaque on.
So after this, I kept my search for another E92 M3 going. I widened my search up a bit, and even though I’m not fond of black cars, I really started to love the Jerez black color. Mostly black, but looks very blue in direct sunlight. I managed to find a two owner 2009 with 40k miles on it, which had also been covered in PPF since the original owner bought it and maintained aggressively. Jerez black over extended palladium silver leather. Bought it (and for not much more than my insurance payout) and shipped it out to me. Unfortunately, when I got it, cosmetically it was rough. The PO maintained it mechanically, but never bothered with the cosmetics. Some cleaning and conditioning really brought the interior back to life. Then I had the PPF removed (the crew looked dead when I picked it up because of that) and some tint installed. Did a light correction and a coating this weekend, now it’s looking good: https://imgur.com/a/3W5tULR 
It’s hard to explain how I feel about these M3s, they just feel special. There are definitely faster and more visceral cars out there, but the E92 just does everything so well, and can be easily modded to your liking. It sounds cheesy, but I’d describe it as the perfect car for a weekend in wine country. You have a comfortable and fairly luxurious interior, decent sound system, an incredible exhaust, and a balanced, responsive and adjustable chassis. Now to get an exhaust on there.",2
"My dad won't let me buy a Miata
Hi r/Cars. 
Recently my car broke down, it was a cheap 2000 civic and had a fair amount of miles on it. I had some cash put away so now I have to use that to buy a new car. I have been pitching the Miata to him for a long time now and he doesn't think it's a good idea. I have found a 1997 with 68k miles and he says because bits old it'll break down and isn't reliable. Says it's a sports car and is meant for people with 20,000 dollars to spend on a car and fix them up. Am I confused on how reliable miatas usually are? Does older mean it's going to break easily? We're the 90's miatas made poorly? I just want to know if I should pursue this car as something that would be reliable or look into a Corolla like he wants. He says a Corolla is ugly but will keep working forever. He ended our conversation saying that no one drives what they want until they're retired. I just would appreciate some advice.
Thanks guys.",2
"Was just given a free car. Its in Mexico. What would reddit do?
It is a 2005 Hyundai Accent, hatchback, manual transmission, with 70,000 miles. Silver.
Why did I get it for free? Well, it spent the last 8000 miles bombing down dirt roads in Baja Mexico, at the hands of my mother. It is scratched and dented all over, the check engine light is on, the drivers door wont open from the inside, and has an odd clicking sound coming from the wheel area during tight turns. The side windows are all smashed out due to a recent hurricane. (Routine maintenance and oil changes have been kept up on.) She no longer wants to deal with it, so if I can get it back to the United States, it is mine for free. 
Im down here already, with no return ticket. Its 1000 miles to California and another 1000 to my destination. Im mechanically apt, I speak passable Spanish, and I have the ability and willingness to abandon this vehicle and get on a bus or a plane home if it breaks down. The stars have aligned.
Should I bother at all?
What should I do to prepare this vehicle for the journey? 
What should I do if I make it home? Autocross? Rallycross? Lemons racing? I dont neccesarily need a beater DD, but Ive been wanting to get into amateur racing for some time now. In the end this is just a fun road trip for me, if it throws a rod pulling into my driveway Ill be perfectly happy.",2

**The words, and plenty of them**
I  had planned this trip since spring but hadn't gone due to work  constraints. A window opened up in September, but it quickly closed due  to life getting in the way. And then it happened:  Early October,  nothing holding me back. I was ready to go, to clear my head, to get  away from work and you. Yes, you - the guy who swerves in and out of  traffic at speed. And you, the lady who cannot stay off her phone. And  don't think I've forgotten about you, bro - I see you hiding back there -  the guy who literally ignores BSM. What better cure for driving  frustration than to go.. driving. Or something.
&#x200B;
**Tramlining and then it got cold**
I  left San Francisco on Friday afternoon, taking 80 east to Reno. This  was well planned, nothing left to chance except for the most common  sense thing:  weather reports. There's an app for that, of which I have 3  and of which I used 0. This was not the smartest move as would be  apparent this night and later in Montana, but for now all was well.  Weather was warm, pavement dry and I'm moving at a good pace through  Sacramento and into the Sierra Nevada range. The mountain section of 80,  specifically the right lane is in terrible shape. I'm tramlining all  over the place for too long, in too many sections, a constant jerky  right, left, left, left, right, right fight on the wheel. Despite this  I'm determined to stay right except to pass.
Its  getting pretty cool out, and about 8PM I pull into the Truckee rest  stop to discover its cold, 38 degrees. I know thats not cold to you  Midwest and East Coast people. Kinda balmy. But to a coastal CA guy  that's just about below freezing. I make a mental note about the  Michelins not being rated for this temp, brush my teeth in the parking  lot (classy is how I roll) and go to bed or rather recline the seat. I  wake at 3AM and its time to move.
Leaving Truckee I discover tramlining is not done and it's another fight.   And then the squeaking started from somewhere in the dash. Its a heavy  grating noise and not a rattle; loud and obnoxious like my nephew. I'm  pressing on the dash, the gauges, the vents - the usual places but  nothing changes. Ten minutes later it's gone and does not return. Took  the Boomtown exit and hit up Chevron. Go inside for coffee and pay for  gas, pretty mundane but then I ran into a change scam. Some Eastern Euro  guy was behind the counter. I give him 40 and he tells me he'll put 35  on the pump, and to come back for change. Not what I asked for but  whatever. Returned for the change and - lets call him Uri - claims  there's no change to be had. Its 3:30AM and I'm in no mood to get into  this. Enjoy the $3 bro.
&#x200B;
**Coffee, water and no rest areas. Also, LTE coverage is terrible**
Back  on the road and passing Reno AKA the drab copy of Vegas. Detector warns  of 2 KA alerts but the signal is weak and I exit Reno without issue.  Kept going east to Winnemucca, turning north on 95. The problem with 95 -  other than being a long stretch through flat arid country - is the lack  of rest areas combined with tidal pool-sized coffee cups and water. You  know what this means and yes, I marked my territory in several places.
This  stretch of nothing leads to the first of far too many LTE signal cuts  and corresponding loss of Waze GPS updates. Through most of NV, and  really, really long stretches of ID and MT there is no signal. Which I  completely understand since ATT ~~is a discount carrier  a small mom  and pop telco   its really hard to relay signals over flat terrain  its  1996 and cell phones are still a novelty~~. Signal loss in WA and OR  along 101 - that I understand, and it happened frequently given the  terrain. But issues in flatlands especially Idaho's more populated state  routes -  that I don't get.
And here's  where I took the first acceptable picture of the car. Its a farming  community, maybe a half mile of 25 MPH with a gas station, coffee house,  cafe and sheriff's station. And one thing I found interesting, the  Sahara Motel. 50s or early 60s design; sharp angles, cracked windows and  peeling paint on the doors.  The last paying guest was a long time ago  and it makes a good backdrop.

**The Rag Company mission aborted; Shelby meets buttocks at Craters of The Moon**
I'm  off to Boise to find a hotel and stop by the Rag Company. Missed their  store hours and tomorrow's Sunday, with Monday a holiday so.. no Rag  Company visit. I chalk it up my usual level of masterful planning and  stay the night at the Holiday Inn in Meridian. if you find yourself  there someday stop by Beto's 24 hour Mexican place. The chicken  chimichanga (fried burrito) is outstanding.
With  sunrise it was time for my first destination open whenever - Craters of  The Moon National Monument. Never been, never heard of it, just a  random find when looking up Idaho tourist destinations. Taking 84 SE was  unremarkable, but connecting to 20 was another story. Going up to 4k  elevation, golden grass on the hills and plains, fall colors on the  trees. Beautiful, with some fun stretches of road interrupted by people  who dr.ive. ve.r.y. s.lo.w.ly.
Passed  through Carey which is another livestock community with the requisite  aroma d'odure. Up to this point I've mostly seen F150s, RAM 1500s and  the occasional minivan. But here comes this kid in his JDM Civic, Idaho  plates, red with all the toppings -  wing, different colored bits here  and there. Didn't check the rear but you know there were fart cans  attached. Flat bill cap tied it all together. What I remember most is  the look on his face as he passed, staring at my car like that guy on  what show was it? The guy with the wild hair who says ""I'm not saying  its aliens.."". Yeah. He had that look on his face. Stay strong, brosef,  you're the outlier in the land of the lifted.
Keep  going and the route takes you over Silver Creek which is famous for  fishing, something I didn't know. Also didn't know that with fish come  bugs and a lot of them. I know how to describe these because I took  Entomology 101:  big ole brownish-yellow, low-flying squishies with lots  of guts. Stopped to carefully clean it off but there's too much bug  juice, a full wash is needed later.
About  2:30PM I rolled in to Craters of The Moon. It looks like the name,  kinda bleak and barren and perfect. Wide, cloudy skies from here to  where the flat earth ends and vaccines aren't needed. I stop by a small  hill and walk up to the crest; hidden behind is another crest. Decent  pictures. Coming down I see some tourists standing around the car. Some  guy is leaning his posterior on the hood and having a picture taken.  This excites me a wee bit and I leg it to explain the finer points of no  touchie; I know its complicated. They are French (not the Quebecois  variety); explanations were offered, much hand gesturing ensued,  apologies made and Trans-Atlantic relations were preserved (you're  welcome, America). I keep rolling albeit with a blood pressure higher  than normal; I like this place minus butt guy.

**Meeting JB from Texas, AKA Walter Mitty**
Back  on the road and I pull over for gas at Picabo. Station appears to be  closing; their coffee is lukewarm and does not look good.  Made my way  to a rest stop for Operation Caffeine Overdose ala Jetboil and French  Press and yes, it was great, full bodied and delicious. Fully amped I  drive east toward Montana and Yellowstone but I can't quite make it. 9PM  rolls around and I stop at a random rest area, writing out notes on the  day. There's a silver Mercedes roadster a few spots over, I'm guessing  early to mid 90s (SLK? Not familiar with Mercedes). It looks really  good, sleek, fast and small. Fender flares, looks like aftermarket  wheels and the driver is staring at my car. I go back to writing notes  and look up a few minutes later. He's still staring. Got out to rummage  for food and that's when the driver walks over:  JB from Texas. 6'4"" or  so and has about 100 lbs on me, in a dark parking area - but that's not  the problem. Problem is he's a close talker. Protip for tall guys  talking to strangers in dark places:  Don't be a close talker.
I  ask JB about his car and he says it was his first, got it new in 99  when he was 15. That's remarkable and I asked how he pulled it off. ""My  parents are the most senior judges in (whatever TX town he's from).""  This was said emphatically and louder than you'd expect, but I figure  it's possible, and wealthy families can buy expensive cars for their  kids. After this point little things were said that raised some flags  but nothing major, things like European cars being cheaper to repair  than domestic. But then it got weird, with JB stating he's a retired Air  Force General, and his wife a retired Navy Colonel (for those  unfamiliar, there are no Colonels in the US Navy). JB doesn't appear old  enough to make 04 much less General, so I ask how old he is and this  produces a long pause-  really long (he was doing the math, 15 in 1999  now its 2018.. this minus that, carry the 1, no wait just subtract, x = y  and divide the ... and he got it wrong). Finally he says ""40."" Amazing.  A 40 YO retired General, he must be a legend I've never heard of. I  decide to leave before the inevitable JSOC story. There's always a JSOC  story.

**Yellowstone and KA bands**
Morning  rolls around and I awake at another rest stop. Get the jetboil going  and its not long before 191 gets me to Yellowstone. Just before the park  is the town of West Yellowstone and here the radar detector pays gives  another assist. A few cars on the road and we're approaching a bend. KA  alert is a sudden, strong signal and there he is, local Sheriff sitting  just past the bend. He starts to follow after I pass but I'm in the  clear. About a mile down I'm the only car on this stretch and just for  giggles he lights me up. I get it, its a holiday weekend and no better  time to get low hanging fruit like speeders and drunks, but come on,  Deputy Dog. I innit stupit. Me gud drivor.
Yellowstone.  Incredible driving roads but again no bueno to open it up, a fact  reinforced by another Deputy exercising his radar skills (quite good, no  alerts at all til I rounded a corner). If you like fly fishin' this is  the place, and I made several hikes with one decent picture to show for  it. That's my bad; arrival time (11AM) meant I had to wait awhile for  acceptable light. Could be there's a pattern here.
&#x200B;
**I visit Ennis and find an El Camino for sale**
Leaving  the park I point the car to Ennis on route 287. This is a  tourist-focused town. You like huntin', maybe fishin', little bit of  hikin', you want it they got it. The main drag is several hundred yards  of contemporary storefronts and they appear to have been designed by the  same person. Quirky, but not too quirky with just the right amount of  rustic, and nicely done enough to let you know its gonna be expensive  shopping there.
Exxon was out of 91 on  all pumps (or 92 in MT) but I found another station. In the gravel lot  next door was a bright light shining through parting clouds, and I may  have heard a chorus because there she was, a 1987 Chevy El Camino, 71k  miles, 10k asking down from 12. Looked in good shape, badged SS and V8. I  didn't closely inspect it, and I'm no expert in verifying SuperSport  models from any era. At any rate trans isn't my thing. But still, good  looking history on wheels.
&#x200B;
**Butte, where the rubber meets the road (or snow, in this case) and Georgetown Lake**
And  now I'm in Butte.  I neither wrote nor recall much of this drive, my  mind said write but my body said sleep. Made it in good time and got a  room, and you know what? It's freaking cold. Like... dude. COLD, low  30s. Up to this point I still haven't checked weather reports because  I'm a rocket scientist. Woke at 5AM and found a coin op car wash and  yes, its cold and getting colder. I'm worried about the tire temp rating  and this is compounded by a light dusting of snow. I realize my IQ has  to catch up and GTFO to a warmer climate. S/SW is good but too obvious.  N/NW is more my mongo style on highway 90; temp decreased to 28 degrees  and snow had built up as a fine slush, but not frozen. At least there's  no snowplows, that would be a bad sign. And then a few miles in there  are snow plows, thankfully they appear to be pre-positioned and sitting  there. This must be one of the first snows of the season, and my escape  velocity is tempered by MPSS running well below threshold. Went gentle  on the inputs, reduced speed and held it steady. No problems keeping it  straight and thankfully stopping distance was not put to the test.
I  self-flagellate for a number of miles, slowly building confidence and  moving from light snow to rain. Stopped at a rest area to inspect the  tires; no cracks or other issues found, nor did any appear during the  trip. The air intake and grille had ice build up, good news is it was a  fairly small area on either side.
I left  90 at Hensley Gulch, turning west on highway 1 AKA Pintier Veterans  Memorial Scenic Highway. This was the most beautiful road of the trip,  its scenic and then some. Rolling, gentle hills, mostly livestock and  horses. More long sweepers with minor elevation changes, and then you  get to Georgetown Lake, otherwise known as the place I'll buy when I win  the lotto. Not been? Go, its worth your time. For me this was a  pass-through, but I'll remember this drive for a long time, a little bit  of paradise I had the privilege to observe.

**Crossing back into Idaho, and the memory of what was**
Back  in Idaho; a light rain and miles of yellows, browns and greens. Cruise  control country like most of the route so far. And then the song played;  the one that takes you back to what was or could have been. The one you  do and don't want to hear, so you bury it, ignore it but can't quite  hit delete. The opening guitar conjures her face and you can feel her  touch. It's good and real and bittersweet and you wonder why it ended,  but you know why.
*some people wind up with the one that they adore*
*in a heart-shaped hotel room it's what a heart is for*
*the bubble floats so madly will it stay sky-high?*
And  suddenly I'm in Tel Aviv with her in that rundown motel by the beach.  The faded yellow walls gave the room a golden light offset by dingy grey  curtains and an ugly rug. Just her and I and this song playing on her  phone. It was a long way from home, across borders, language, religious  and cultural differences. It was also over but we didn't know it just  then; better that way. She's married now. I put the memory back on the  shelf, close the door and leave.
*and it's you and me in the summertime we'll be hand in hand down in the park*
*with a squeeze and a sigh and that twinkle in your eye and all the sunshine banishes the dark*

**The A/C goes to the great condenser in the sky**
A  month before leaving I attempted to get some issues addressed:  Rear  panel gaps, unreliable A/C, front wheel well liner not flush and a  poorly fitted passenger door. My dealership put their best guys on the  job and the results were:  Panel gap parts on backorder  (understandable), unreliable A/C diagnosed as ""normal,"" wheel well liner  was ""normal"" and nothing can be done about the door. I was impressed  and decided to find another dealer after the trip. But now the A/C  decides its time to meet its maker. No A/C, no heat, no joy. Top men,  Dr. Jones. *Top. Men*.

**Coeur D'Alene Lake:  Flatbed hauls a totaled 911 and Camry**
I  arrived at Coeur D'Alene. Passed through a few times before but never  stopped by the lake, and I'm glad I did. 50 square miles of water  surrounded by hills with marinas interspersed along the shore. Twisty  roads with some straights that reminds me of Skyline. Only here I take  it easy, I don't know the roads so I run an inspection cruise along a 20  mile run:  1 cross, 7 deer in 2 groups, 2 school bus stops, 0 cyclists.  Not ideal especially the school bus stops and deer, and local popo are  running  KA band. I drive it anyway, moderately. On the way out I see a  flatbed loaded up with a wrecked white 911 (recent) and Camry (00's  model). The Porsche's passenger door is off the frame and the roof looks  partially caved.

**Washington State expert editorial and heroin at the rest stop**
I've  never lived in WA but I'm nonetheless an expert with a viewpoint that  applies to every resident, because I'm smart and stuff.  They don't care  for Californians because too many moved here, a PNW echo chamber that  goes back decades and won't end, well, ever. Which is fine because no  one ever moved to CA and drove up prices, in greater numbers and with  greater consequences. They have a lot of tweakers, which CA also has a  lot of. They share a coastline with Oregon and Canada that is hands down  the most beautiful and inspiring you'll find anywhere. And their popo  are a revenue generator force, more than most places.
Pulled  in to a rest stop shortly after crossing the border. Camped out in the  car and got the usual restless sleep. Up at 4AM to visit the men's  room, and out walks Slim Shady's cousin with a red hat, red jersey of  some kind, black basketball shorts and red basketball shoes. Slim left  behind a syringe, one of those rubber hose things they use to tie off,  an empty brown packet about the size of rubber packaging and some random  bits and bobs. I return to the car thinking how sad it is this guy has a  fix at the ready while preparing the jetboil and french press, and only  later does the irony become obvious. As I said, I'm smart. And stuff.
&#x200B;
**Field testing AMMO NYC'S Frothe (hoseless wash)**
I  exited 90 beyond Snoqualmie Pass, fill up and decide to test AMMONYC's  hoseless wash product. Disclaimer:  I have no relationship with AMMO,  and I paid for the product just as you would. There's a TA truck stop  adjacent to the gas station and I park in between them, well out of  anyone's way. The car has road grime, some bugs, the usual detritus but  nothing too heavy.
I used the sprayer  with water first to rinse, then added Frothe and got down to business  except for one thing:   Parking a Shelby by truckers is like throwing  chum into a sea of dorsal fins. I'm getting my foam on when I get my  first visitor, Mike, 61, trucker and retired diesel mechanic. Mike's a  nice guy but his intro was, ""What in the hell are you doing?"" I explain  the concept but he looks doubtful, then I get the car stories (this V8,  and that one, and some other one). Good conversation but I gotta work on  this so Mike and I part ways.
Next up  was another trucker, I didn't get his name. Large guy, about Mike's age  and he approaches close but doesn't say anything, just stares at the  car. I break the ice and he says, ""I'd give you a run against my  Hellcat."" I'm not down to measure manhoods or compare cornering so I  don't. He inspects the car and doesn't like the PPF, doesn't like  hoseless wash. He does like the shine but I get a blank stare when  explaining what ceramic coating is. All this was fine until he decides  to touch the paint:  ""Is that a rock chip?"" I don't know what it is  about paint but some people can't stop themselves from touching it.
Second  and last visitor gone I continue with Frothe. Easy to use, lifting the  dirt does take a fair number of towels (6 in my case) and that's fine,  I've brought a lot. No visible scratches or swirls but I didn't go CSI  on this, it's clean, it shines and I was careful to follow the lifting  vs pushing method. Very happy with the results but the pictures don't do  it justice. See the Seattle/Pike's Place pic for a good representation,  it was taken not long after with a good amount of miles driven.
&#x200B;
**Speed, Karma & Laser** **~~Cats~~** **Cops**
Continuing  on 90 its flat agricultural land that reminds me of CA's central region  with more rainfall. Traffic is very light, only a few cars and this  Corolla - I'm thinking early 2000s model - comes up fast behind me.  Really fast. What's remarkable is the great condition of the paint, this  car is cosmetically well taken care of. I know because the driver, lets  put him on the younger side of 18, passed at high speed and very close,  swerving to lane change. I deploy the universal sign of disapproval and  hope he learns his lessons before its too late. 20 miles down the road I  see flashing lights and the state patrol is keeping him company. Karma,  bro. It don't mess around.
On my last WA  visit the city of Pasco (further south, not far from the OR border) had  an aggressive ticketing posture. This time I didn't write down the  name, no time to pull over - just a city between Snoqualmie and Seattle.  KA band up ahead, and another a 1/2 mile after that. But they're not  done, this is a pack operation. Mr. Laser Cop is parked after the 2nd KA  cruiser, and its clear they mean (big) business.  This was the second  laser strike in WA during this trip. Thankfully I did not contribute to  the register.
&#x200B;
**Seattle and Pike's Place**
In  my mind this was going to be a great picture, something to print. Low  light, low angle, blazing Pike's Place sign in the background. Got there  too late for that, about 10AM due to heavy traffic and the Frothe field  test. No biggie. Only problem is I'm from SF where car break ins are  rampant and my car is chock full of stuff. Leave it like this at home  and you're coming back to broken glass so I keep the car in sight.
Lets  see.. Starbucks, not my first choice and it looks like Disneyland with  all the tourists. I find an indy coffee purveyor, enjoy my dose and buy  some overpriced t-shirts. And then its time to leave, but I drive around  and I'm reminded that Seattle is what SF used to be:  Not too crowded  and a little laid back. Locals will tell you otherwise and the COL is  too high, and there's too many people from CA who moved here, and  they're right and wrong. But its vibe is nothing like SF and I hope it  stays that way. Seattle is its own thing.
&#x200B;
**Newport, Oregon and the awkward stop light**
I'm  driving through Newport, another coastal town and this one has a fine  dining establishment I'm keen to visit, Taco Bell. You may have heard of  them, may I recommend the 20oz Mountain Dew for optimal caffeine  delivery. Leaving town I stop at a light, windows down because the *Top. Men.*  did such a great job with the aircon. A Chevy truck (older one, S10  maybe) pulls up alongside. The driver has a ball cap on backwards, dark  sunglasses and a Tom Selleck mustache. ""Hey man! I'm a Chevy guy but I  really like your car, that back end is something! Love how you put it  together!"" The words form in my head and my mouth opens to speak but  he's gone before I can say anything. So there I was, mentally  constipated long before the physical effects of this value meal, unable  to tell him with urgency and a longing for relief that no, its stock and  I'm not a Ford engineer or modding genius. Frustrating.

**I ordered pizza and met our Lord and Savior**
I  stopped for dinner at a town close to Eugene. Its time for something  healthy, like pizza. Yeah. Pepperoni and a cold one will do. Nice enough  place, nothing fancy and nothing you'd remember. Except the guy who  took my order was Jesus Christ Superstar. Brown shoulder length hair and  a full beard, neatly done. Semi-olive complexion and I'm wondering if  my Aramaic is up to speed, or whether I should be his agent for the  Broadway revival. Mostly I'm wishing my long hair days hadn't ended and I  briefly wallow in envy. At any rate the pizza was good and Jesus was a  nice guy. Good to know.
&#x200B;
**The end**
..   just kidding. I kept driving south, down to CA, following 101 as it  looped in and out of the coast. It wasn't until Eureka that I was  reminded of a specific subculture. The sun was setting as I drove  through, and this is it, i knew it - The Walking Dead isn't fiction, its  right here, game over and all I've got is a multitool. But it was only  the patchouli and herb loving drum circle crowd and there were a lot of  them coming out of the shadows. Maybe Phish was playing, but I think  they broke up? Doesn't matter. Welcome back to California. I'm so  excited to visit my dealership and have a really long conversation about  the A/C, my feelings and unmet expectations and maybe a hug at the end.  Nah, forget that. Time to find a dealer who will offer solutions and  options. Wish me luck.

"Just test drove my first performance car, a 2009 BMW M3.
...And I don't know how to make sense out of my feelings about it.
I'm a huge BMW fan, always have been. The first car I ever wanted was the previous-gen e46 M3, and in my eyes the e92 is one of the most beautiful, aggressive, inspiring cars there has ever been. Needless to say I was really excited to drive it.
First impressions--good lord, what a great interior. Roomy, comfortable, yet totally focused on driving. Sitting in there makes you feel like a bullet staring out the barrel of a gun (in a good way). I drove one with the DCT and the paddles feel great. The steering wheel is amazing and one of the best parts of the car.
Inside and out, when you're sitting in it, the car feels bigger than I expected. Maybe it's the long hood, or the low seating position emphasizing the car's width (Aside--jerez black is one of the best paint colors I've ever seen, metallic and very subtly blue).
When I got on the road is when I started to get confused.
First off, I drive a Hyundai Veloster Turbo. It's not fast and it doesn't handle well, but it's quick and light. I was worried that due to its weight and top-loaded engine, the M3 wouldn't be torquey enough for me. I was wrong. As far as the right foot goes, the M3 is a fucking ROCKETSHIP. Instant throttle response, that ungodly roar from the exhaust when you pass 4k rpm, and that engine keeps on pulling long after it should have given up. Shifts are quick and precise, both up and down. Even with 7 speeds, each gear feels longer than in my Veloster. Also, the Veloster feels uncomfortable in gears 1-2, like it wants to lug down to a stop or get to a 35mph cruising speed, not hang out in the middle. No such thing in the M3--its comfortable in any gear, at any rpm.
The M3 handles great too, I think. I took some windy roads at a higher-than-advised speed and the car was glued to the pavement. I never approached its grip limits, so I can't comment on its neutral handling behavior. I also didn't figure out how to turn the TC off until after the test drive, so I didn't even break the tires loose. 
The confusing thing was the feel. It was ungodly fast, utterly unflappable around corners, comfortable, and had the most exciting soundtrack I've ever heard. But the steering--although fairly precise and nicely weighted--had no road feel to it. The brakes seemed vaguely squishy. The ride was firm yet smooth, and still almost no road feel is transmitted through the seat. At 65mph it feels like going 40. In some respects it was more like a video game than driving a car.
Is this what people mean by driving a slow car fast vs. driving a fast car slow? There's no question the M3 was more fun than my Veloster, but I almost had to break the law to feel anything in the M3. Honestly I could have driven in a perfectly straight line for an hour and had the same subjective experience. I would have expected this with the f80, I didn't expect it with the e92. Is it really the case that performance cars are only fun at the limit? Is the e92 really just a GT car, not a corner-carving enthusiasts' car? Was the steering supposed to be that numb? Do I just need to try the manual?
If anyone has experienced this, I'd love to hear about it. Owners of e9x M3s, please chime in. I really wanted to love this car, and although I'm itching to drive it again, I think it's more to try and feel what I didn't feel the first time than to replicate what I did feel. Otherwise, I'm almost ready to say fuck it and look for a Miata or a Cayman.",2
"The Journey across America in my old Camaro, 8200 miles, Coast to Coast.
Hey freinds, I have a car story to tell. Its about my journey across the USA, Boston to California.
 
Some may have seen my post in early Febuary of this year about the purchase of my car, a 2000 Camaro LS1 6 speed Convertible. It had 140k miles when I bought it in a snowstorm of an older gentleman. I was the first one who called and payed $5200 for this sled. I knew it was a real car when I saw the ad on craigslist. ""LS1 T56"" pumped my gnads. 
Almost peed my pants, so I posted this.
https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/7vihyc/just_bought_my_first_camaro_z28/?st=JKD1N31T&sh=fedd26b5
I learned how to drive stick on the test drive and on the way home through Boston, snow blazing the roads and my heart beating through my chest, careful not to fuck with anything that could break. 
https://imgur.com/gallery/iQmsqWl
Parked it in my driveway against my parents wishes and day after day, fixed the odds and ends until I was able to put her on the road. (Waited until spring beacuse salted roads can eat my shorts)
https://imgur.com/gallery/kts0vXV
Fast forward to mid June and its been my daily driver, At this point Ive learned down shifting, road carving, and how to do decent burnouts. This car was turnkey and the LS1 sounded the balls anywhere from 2500 and up. It was time to make moves. After planning for around 2 years, I had finally finished school, quit both my jobs, moved out of my folks home, and Hit the road west with everything to my name in my shitty cramped trunk. 
Over the past 36 days, I have driven 8200 miles through America. 
https://imgur.com/gallery/aHLPqtH
Because of my passion for filming, I made a mini series on youtube of my journey. Its called ""Driven through America"" (cant post link because mods, please dont ban me)
Ive driven down through Apalacia, into the deep South through AL, MS, and TX. Up through CO, into WY, ID, and MO. Then straight down through the desert into Las Vegas, and now SoCal, where Im posted up at a friends. 
https://imgur.com/gallery/iA2Z8w2
This damn sled has been nothing but loyal to me, providing me with a smile every time I downshift and nail the throttle to pass someone on the highway. One of my favorite feature is the double overdrive 6th gear, sip sip. 
Heres to this car, and to all the other heads out there who are questioning if you should do the same. The sky is the limit, work steady, be humble and execute when the time is right. Vehicles will always be my passion and Im super glad that everyone here at r/cars has been there for me and everbody else to push eachother into the unknown so we can discover new roads and tare the pavement up. Bonus pick of me cheesing :

"Discussing the Rotary engine a bit..
Okay so as a preface you can call me biased if you want but I own both a rotary and a piston and I like them both equally also I am by no means an expert on either type of engine.
**Common complaints**
* ""Rotaries flood all the time, you can't start/stop them at all"" In short: No they don't. I daily drive mine and can start then turn it off nearly instantly as much as I want (have done it about 7 times in a row one day while working on it in my shop. And even if they do flood it's simple to de-flood them. Either hold the gas all the way to the floor while turning it over or pull the fuel pump fuse and crank it for a minute and your problem is solved.
* ""They have no torque, the engine is lifeless"". If you want torque then get something with displacement, a rotary has 1.2/1.3l of displacement and you expect torque? Would you complain about a 1.3l piston engine not having torque? Of course you wouldn't because that wouldn't make any sense at all. 
* ""They're confusing and hard to work on"". They aren't hard to work on at all, they're different. If the first engine you worked on was a rotary then a piston engine would seem confusing to you too. They only have 3 moving parts and a bunch of seals. There's a video series that literally goes through an entire rebuild process out there made by Mr. Aaron Cake on Youtube. You can learn the basics of working on a Rotary in about a week and could probably rebuild one after about 2 weeks of doing some research if you're mechanically apt.
**Failures:**
Basically the main two reasons a rotary engine fails are..
* Carbon lock. Carbon build up along the face of the rotor which sticks a seal, the face is large so there's a lot of room for carbon to slowly build and all of the seals on the rotor have a spring under them which keeps them pushed against the housing. If the seal gets stuck then you don't have much compression therefore a ""blown"" engine. This is normally fixed by pouring ATF into the engine, letting it soak, and moving the rotor a little bit or pushing on the seal through the exhaust port to free it from the carbon. Carbon build up is also contributed to by using pan oil rather than premix because conventional oil doesn't burn as clean as 2 stroke and thus leaves deposits.
* Apex seal breaking. Either from lack of oil or eventual wear (the seal is big so it wears a bit faster than a piston ring).
Other seals can obviously break but these are the two main reasons. Both are easily avoidable by premixing and doing a ""de-carbonizing"" routine every once in a while.
The routine is either redline the car once a day or once every few months or so you run some water through the engine to ""steam clean"" it. I personally do both and run about a gallon through each rotor then take the car on a drive afterwards to make sure there's not any extra water in the engine after the treatment is done.
Meth/Water injection is extremely good for these engines because it's like a mini-treatment every time you drive the car. There are a few people who after rebuilding their engines have put in a injection kit then after racing the engine for a while have torn it down and found it to be completely spotless. It has been called a rotary-saver.
People give these engines a lot more grief than they deserve because they're different. But they forget that the engines are good at things too like handling high rpm driving for extended periods since they don't have valves and valve springs that wear out quickly.
I will add more categories or more info if people find this interesting or want to discuss/ask questions.
**Edit**: You know what? Let's do this. We'll have a spectrum of the 3 main types of engines in production.
Diesel: Very torquey, very reliable, low rpm power.
Gas piston: Pretty torquey, pretty reliable, power where it's tuned to be (middle of the road).
Rotary: Low torque, pretty reliable, high rpm power and not much low range.",2
"I almost fucked up, guys
Hey guys, I'm writing this to you because I feel like you'd be the least judgmental out of everyone (ironic I know). 
I've been a gearhead for the past couple of years (I'm 18) and I just love cars. Of course, at my age that love of cars also translates into love of speed. Overall, I'm a very responsible driver and follow all the rules of the road (the only exception being driving slightly over the speed limit, like 5-10, or even 20 over on the highway) However, I love reading about cars and I hope that I can have a long, prosperous life as a car lover.
However, today I almost fucked up. I was in my parent's car (MB '11 C350) and the adrenaline/testosterone mix got a bit too high. I turned ESC off and decided to play around a bit. As I was pulling left into my driveway I ripped the gas in order to get some tail action (that RWD + 3.5 V6) and I heavily understeered. There's a tree on the right side of my driveway and I was heading straight for it. I thought I was going to fucking eat it. I slammed so hard on the breaks that I thought the car was gonna buck, but I stopped a couple of inches short. I swear I almost died. 
Not only was I ashamed of myself but I almost shat my pants because we just got the car a month ago (CPO) and my parents would have fucking murdered me. Thankfully I'm alright and the car is too, but now I know to not fuck around anymore.

"I test drove A Tesla Model 3 Standard Range here is my Review.
**Experience**: Everyone at the Jacksonville Tesla Showroom were very friendly and they appreciated that I showed up to the test drive early. They answered any questions I had with no delays. The test drive went smoother than expected Friberiro (employee at Showroom) helped make this a test drive to remember.
**Previous car**: 2013 BMW 328i ZF 8-speed ( I really don’t miss this car)
**Current car**: Honda Civic EX-T’16 CVT
*Note*: This is my opinion based on one test drive. If I said the wrong information for the touch screen or anything else please correct me.
*Duration of test drive*: 1:05 pm to 1:45 pm 40 minutes 
*Type of driving*: Mixed driving intercity traffic, interstate driving and the suburb's 
**Cons**
**The doors closing**- When you close them it makes a loud clank sound. The showroom Model 3 actually made a louder sound than the test car I drove. The sound makes it seem like the doors are going to break every time you close them. 
**The ride quality**- I expected the quality to be slightly better. ( it may have to do with the tester riding on 19 in chrome wheels). Did not ride over bumps as well as expected. I felt light thuds when riding over bumps or road inconsistencies sometimes.
**Neutral**
**The Higher floor**- The higher floor of the car (due to the battery being low in the car) bother me in the first minutes of the test drive but I got used to it. The higher floor will hamper back seat room, I'm 6'1 sitting in the back seat I felt I had solid knee room and 2 inches of headroom I have a 3-inch tall Mohawk (although the front seat at that current setting was somewhat of a tight squeeze). The higher floor helps with visibility.
**The Speaker** - The sound system in this car is solid. But I don't get to test cars to often also I had the stereo volume low throughout the ride. I was busy talking to the Tesla Employee during the test drive.
**The Glovebox icon (button)**- Personally for me, this would not be a problem because the glove box icon is easily identifiable to open it then. I could lean to the right and close it. If you are a passenger I could see how this is a problem. 
**The Card**- The card is an interesting take instead of using a real key (which they actually offer). You place the card on the Model 3's RFID transmitter on the top of the left door B pillar it unlocks the car. Then you place the card on the bottom portion of the center console.
**The Pro's**
**The low front hood** - The low front hood provides forward visibility I haven't experience in any car. Combined with the high floor gives you an amazing view of what's ahead of you. Making the car more placeable and effortless.
**The front trunk** – Since there is no engine in the front you get a frunk to store items in 😊
**The door handles** -I'm a fan of the door handles of this car they feel sturdy, solid and the push and pull of them is nice in my opinion (better than the B.S. the P100d had in the showroom.)
**INSTANT TORQUE!!!!!!!!!!!!** - The instant torque from the electric motors is just spectacular. The instant response is just amazing even in the Standard range model every time I pushed the pedal I could not help myself from giggling and laughing. I never knew pulls from 20-35 mph or 15-25mph or even 45-50 mph could be so fun (I did not test the more powerful trim levels). I know you have heard this many times but the instant torque from the electric motors is addicting(You don't have to drive at extreme speeds to enjoy this car just a light tap on the gas is all you need). When driving this car I didn't care about the sound of the car. The linear acceleration makes driving the car on roads easy and predictable. It felt like no gap was too small for this car.
**The touch screen**- The touchscreen in the Tesla Model 3 is extremely easy and simple to use in my opinion. The response of the screen makes it that much better to drive. It only took me 3 to 4 minutes to figure the basics of the menu out. The options you are most likely to use are on the front page. The bottom of the screen acts like buttons. I thought changing the steering wheel position and mirrors would be overcomplicated but it was very simple and easy. I just touch the mirror icon on the screen then use the left scroll wheel to move it up, down, left and right. For the steering wheel I touch the icon near the top right of the screen and adjust the steering wheel using the scroll wheel in (left) out(right) up(scroll up) down(scroll down) the steering wheel adjusts quickly and for me it was easy to find the right steering wheel position. Nearly all functions of this car are one or to touches away. When driving a quick glance to the left for viewing the speed I didn’t feel any need for a HUD in the test drive.
**Low Center of Gravity**- The batteries and motor being integrated so low in the car give it a planted feel. Even the moment we left the parking lot I commented on how planted the car feels, although the car is heavy the Tesla felt extremely balanced in 40mph-50mph sweepers rotating its mass well. 
**Panoramic roof** – The panoramic roof in the Model 3 is lovely it makes the car feel more spacious and bigger than it actually is. I believe the tenting for the roof is just right. During my test drive, it was over 85 degrees in Jacksonville and I noticed settle temperature changes. I personally like how it’s standard.
**Regenerative Braking** – The regenerative braking in this car feels great ( I don’t have much experience with regenerative braking). Driving and never stepping on the brake pedal is an experience. At first, the standard regen felt too strong but after 10 minutes or so I got used to it. The low regen setting is slightly too low for my liking. It would be nice in the future (I’m not sure if a current production car has this) A setting to modulate regen braking by a percentage.
**Electric Motor Wine** – Even though the sound of the motors is very faint ab interesting whoosh enters the cabin. In model 3, you have to turn off the radio and air condition to use it. This sounds futuristic and the lack of Noise really makes you focus on the acceleration.
**Autonomous parking**- Yeah that was really cool.
**Air Flow**- Even though you have to go in the menu instead of just turning a plastic vent. The customization of air flow from all directions is incredible. Making you feel like an air bender in real life controlling streams of air at your fingertips. It makes moving a plastic vent up, down , or left feel archaic in comparison. 
**What I didn't test out**
Autopilot, Easter Eggs, Tesla Phone App, Summon Feature 
**Conclusion**: For me, this is one of the best cars I have ever driven the instant acceleration that brings joy every time I step on the pedal. Easy to use touchscreen makes the car a breeze to configure and futuristic feeling. While typing this review I want to drive that Model 3 again. Even with the problems Tesla has had I have respect for the technology and performance of their cars. Can’t wait for exciting EV’s Tesla and others pump out in the upcoming years. If you have the chance I believe you should test out a Tesla or a proper Electric car.",2
"Quick Rant About Winter Driving
Last night I went out bowling with some friends I haven't seen in awhile. After a few games we decided to head on out and get some food. 
The entrances and exits of the alley are ~10ft long but they are pretty steep, combine this with the snow we've gotten and they were pretty slick to get into. We were pulling out and my friend was in front of me. When he was going down the ramp that was noticeably icy I stopped at the top to prevent an accident from occurring. Common sense right? Nope!
After my friend pulled onto the main road I creeped down the hill and was waiting for a break in traffic. Out of the corner of my eye I see movement in my mirror and go to my friend A ""Oh f*ck, that guys gonna hit us"". Sure enough, the guy slid right into my rear bumper. I was highly pissed off pulled forward a little bit got out of the truck and looked at the bumper. Everything seemed okay and I just told the guy whatever, he cracked his bumper anyway.
Then as I'm walking back to get into the truck, I see the crossover start sliding again and it hits my truck a second time. So I go through the same process, pull forward a little and check the rear bumper. Everything is still okay so I eventually leave once traffic clears. I just wish more people payed attention to the roads when they're slick and icy. Also, the first time didn't upset me but the second time certainly did.
Rant Over. Thanks for reading.",2
"Bought a 2018 GTI SE, broke and happy
So I test drove a GTI with my wife, she give me a nod, I pulled the trigger. It a little fun car great for DD and much better than my Malibu.
&#x200B;
By no means is a stock GTI fast, but this car gives me the unique feeling that I'm in my own small world getting high. It has the flat bottom steering wheel, make it easy for getting in and out, and the best of it is, forcing me to grab the wheels  in the correct way and cross my arms like a teen trying to look professional; It has these tight seats, that are too tight for me now but I'm counting on it to break in just a little; it has proper suspension, not so supportive around fast tight ramps but on bumpy roads it reminds me I'm in a sporty little can; It stares at me like a angry cute panda in black and white, when I admire it from my bedroom window; it can be tuned, but I bought it loving the way it is now.
&#x200B;
The most funny point, it plays engine noise through the Soundaktor to the cabin. I know a lot of people don't like it since it's half fake. But the sound makes me excited, and when I don't want it I can turn it down. When driving it, it's like fireworks only I can see, in my small world. Compared to loud exhaust that bothers people, I prefer this one, keeping it to myself.
&#x200B;
Just so happy that feel I need to do something, so made this post to share. Life is a blink, drive what you want.",2

"I drove my 17 year old miata 3500 miles round trip to Laguna Seca. Didn't break down, and was a ton of fun
Grabbed this 01 LS With 98k miles 6 months ago. After I just got home im at 108k Or so.  I've shared it a lot on /r/miata.  I routinely go drive the mountains of Colorado, do autocross and started to do a few track days.  Car has been extremely reliable but then last week on the way home from autocross my alternator died on me.    Ordered a used one on ebay for $75 and luckily it showed up on time. 
My friends helped me swap it in one night outside my townhouse (no garage ftl) and I was back in action. Then the battery died the next day.   Swapped it for a new one and prayed the car was ready for this weekend. 
I had a few friends go last year but I was busy that weekend.  This year I was free so Of course when my buddies decided to go to MRLS again I had to join. 
We left Wednesday afternoon and arrived in Vegas around 4am.  Slept for a few hours and left for our airbnb in Salinas Ca. 
Eventually we got there with no issues.  It was Convoy of three of us. A newly purchased (that day!) 10ae, my 01LS /and my buddy towed his nb and another friends NA. 
Love this little car. So reliable.  
Had a great time on the track. The corkscrew is amazing and the track is nothing like I imagined it from Forza. So much elevation change.  Just a blast.  I'm slow and wasnt going for lap times but just really enjoyed driving my Miata where it's meant to be.  
On the way back my fiancée flew out for the drive back.  
Colorado got a foot of snow today but by the time we made it back, it was melted. 
The miata had zero issues cruising at high speeds for 5 days.  The speed limit was 80mph. I had a great time. Very few cops.   Slowed down at the co border and there was a Colorado state patrol waiting there.  Luckily I passed him at the speed limit;)
Colorado was absolutely beautiful this time of year.  I'll upload some pics later. 
Hope to do the same thing next year but maybe tow it. I initially planned to tow it with my old landcruiser but decided 10mpg and a $300 trailer rental was bad idea.  Drove the miata and got between 20 and 35mpg depending on the drive.  Best gas prices was $2.40 for premium.  Worst was when I put regular in for $4.29 in the middle of nowhere. Got 2 gallons to get me on my way. 
Wore hunting earplugs and that helped substantially but my ears are still ringing.  I should have brought more ear protection
Awesome time.   Saw so many cool miatas there. I'll upload more pics later

"This is my dad's 1962 Chevy Nova Convertible. Today was the first day it's moved under its own power in over 25 years.
Here is a video of me pulling out of the garage, not great quality but I was more excited to drive it than take video. Wanted the video for my dad as he just had surgery and couldn't be there: https://youtu.be/fGbvz8x4CrQ
And an album with a few photos: https://imgur.com/gallery/zeh8q
Edit: took some more pictures including some of the interior today: https://imgur.com/gallery/btJkR
This car has quite a story, I'll just give the gist though. My dad got the car something like 27 or 28 years ago as payment for a debt a friend owed him. My dad asked this friend of his about when he was going to get paid and the guy told him he could have any car in his garage. My dad knew that his friend had the Nova as well as half a dozen or so other classics so he said he wanted the 62 Chevy.
Now, my dad was in SLC and his friend and the car were in southern California. So he flew down after his friend said the car was ready to go but upon arrival found the car was trapped in the garage because a tree had sprouted and gotten pretty big in the driveway. The car had some other minor problems at the time so after the tree was cut and the oil changed etc he drove it home. Along the way the radiator sprung a leak and he repaired it with chewing gum (I remember him showing me the gum on the radiator when I was a kid but I'm not sure if that's really all it took). Anyway, he made it back to Salt Lake and after a few rides around town he parked it with the intention of restoring it. That never happened. The car sat so long it stopped working and eventually the motor seemed to sieze. 
For years I've bugged him about it and a few years ago we got a good start by pulling the motor and putting in time to just get it running but it's been a slow process. I moved away and he has gotten older so he found a guy to rebuild the motor, update the suspension and breaks, and other odds and ends. Today the new wheels and tires arrived and I'm in town visiting so we got those on and pulled it out of the garage. It's about to snow and it needs a couple minor things (like gas) so tonight it went up and down the driveway but tomorrow we should be able to go for a drive (Top is broken so it's going to be a cold one).
I'll add some more pictures tomorrow if the weather cooperates and I'm happy to answer any questions.",2
"Focus RS test drive by a Mustang and former RS owner (long)
Yesterday, it was time for my 2016 Mustang GT to go in for its first oil change and service, and the good folks att Upplands Motor in Stockholm made sure I was well entertained while waiting for the work to be done, by giving me a little under an hour in a brand new Focus RS!
*Exterior:*
Starting from the outside of the car, the first thing that strikes you is the rake of the thing. It’s a wedge-shaped compact car with a deep and very functional-looking front splitter, and a high spoiler and raised rear end making for a very aggressive road stance. The Nitrous Blue paint job has a remarkable sparkling effect which photos don’t do justice. Little pinpricks of diamond glitter are strewn about the whole car giving it a very high-end look. 
Coming around to the rear I noticed that the exhaust pipes have the look of an aftermarket system, with that thin sheet metal, about the same diameter as the Mustang, but with a much more aggressive look. 
*Interior:*
Getting in the car, the first thing I noticed is that at 6’1’’, I had a considerable blind spot in the B-pillar. I’m used to this from five door cars, but you grow truly accustomed to the freedom of a 2- or 3-door body style where your side view is uninterrupted. Man, what a difference 3 doors would have made to this whole car. 
The interior feels cheapish, the plastics are rather bad and everything has a very ‘1990s stereo’ feel to it, with seemingly jagged edges and protruding features coming out of the dashboard. In comparison, the Mustang’s cockpit feels both cleaner and more upscale as hard as that maybe to believe. The dials are impossibly busy, with demarkations sneezed out in all directions. The whole interior feels more Swatch, and less Omega. The blue stitchwork on the handbrake, shift gaiter, and steering wheel, however, is wonderful. 
The Recaro seats, remarkably, actually didn’t offer me as much side support as I would have hoped. They look the part, but the back support bit is very flat and wide, so I found myself well penned in, but with too much room to move. The seat back is very thin and the whole seat flexes alarmingly if you just push it backward with your head. I didn’t expect this, but the Recaros in the Mustang feel much better. 
The small diameter steering wheel fits beautifully in your hands. A better, more pronounced ‘10 and 2’ would have been good, but the wheel feels joyful and connected, it’s a real pleasure. 
*Driving impressions:*
Starting the car it sounds very normal and understated, I remember my first impression being ‘ is this an RS’? Later on you’ll find that this issue resolves itself easily with the exhaust’s more sporty setting. 
The clutch is extremely abrupt, and bites very hard, very fast. Throttle response is very direct, and the whole car feels tingly, very tight and ready. Coming from a rock-hard Mk1 Focus RS into a rather soft-sprung American cruiser, I’ve missed this feeling. The steering feels connected, too, unlike the Mustang’s. Even if the varying amounts of assistance in the different driving modes are noticeable, the steering always feels tight and connected. It’s been a while since a steering rack talked to me like this. It’s lovely. 
Over bumps and uneven road surfaces, the car is very bumpy in its two harder drive modes, but very floaty in its looser settings. There is a very apparent difference in suspension hardness and ride comfort which is good. I’d say that over the course of normal driving, the ideal point would be somewhere in the middle, because the hard setting means the car skips over bumps, and the soft setting means the car loses a lot of that lovely tightness. 
Sadly, the RS suffers from the infuriating modern-day affliction of artificial exhaust cracks and pops on liftoff. The exhaust pops feel completely artificial and actually detract from the experience. The same carefully monitored, carefully produced pop, every time you lift the gas pedal. It feels like an afterthought, a sound effect, and has nothing to do with how much load the engine is under. Frankly, it made me furious.
*Launch Control and acceleration*
The computer display in the center dash is somewhat sluggish and doesn’t really lend itself to making adjustments on the move, since you find yourself never really knowing how many times you pressed that button before the computer catches up. It is, however, necessary to flip through some menus to access one of the car’s best features: Launch Control.
Set it, plant your foot on the gas, and the car will hold itself at about 5000 RPM (with a lovely rally car PAPAPAPAPAP), dump the clutch and the car just goes. There’s no wheelspin, no struggle for grip, it just goes. The Launch control function is absolutely savage, period. The acceleration - and I know it’s a cliche - literally hurts your neck muscles. The RS hooks up so well from a standing start that it is unbelievable. 
Compared to the Mustang, which spins its wheels in first and second gear seemingly no matter how you modulate the power, I can understand that the RS is 0.1s quicker to 60. The way that car launches is the secret to its acceleration. From a standing start, this car is peerless in its price category. However, from about 5000 RPM and up you can feel that the V8 has more acceleration, more power. In the RS, the overboost function runs out of steam quite quickly, and  found that onece off overboost, the car actually slows down considerably and doesn't feel nearly as fast. There’s also a noticeable turbo lag - which some people may be detrimental - but it does feel like an old-school turbo. Put your foot down, wait for it, brace yourself.
In contrast, the Mustang feels like riding a wave of constant torque, and there is something extremely satisfying about planting your foot, and getting a predictable, immediate, response which washes over you and just doesn't stop all the way to redline. 
*Drift mode*
It’s no secret that this car’s selling point is the ‘drift button’, or the driving mode which bears that name. Press the driving mode button until you see a sideways RS, and away you go!
Compared to track mode, drift mode feels very soft and loose, with light steering, just as you would expect, to lower grip levels and improve countersteering reaction time. Surprisingly, though, the car isn't as easy to provoke into a drift as you would think. It doesn't feel particularly rear wheel drive at all. Compared to the Mustang, which is easily provoked in any situation (and with the traction control in any setting), you really have to work hard to get the RS sideways, even in Drift mode. This is partially due to the frankly amazing levels of mechanical grip, and partially thanks to the fact that this car,if we're honest, feels rather front wheel drive. They can go on as much as they want about the drift setting, but the simple fact is that when provoked, this car understeers.
Once it does break sideways the feeling is problematic. It doesn't feel like natural oversteer which comes from power and weight transfer, rather it feels like a very artificial type of wheelspin and oversteer, which makes it different to any other car I've driven, but also somehow unsatisfying. It feels more like ‘hide understeer mode’ than it feels like ‘drift mode’.
The best way I can explain it is this. There was a video game I played when I was younger, that had a button for ‘wheelspin’. You pressed that button and in any situation you found yourself you would immediately get a burst of wheelspin. This is sort of what Drift mode felt like. It didn't really affect the handling of the car, or introduce any real slip angle (unless you REALLY tried). It didn’t even behave in an analog fashion once it did break loose. It just made the wheels spin a little, the car went a little sideways, and I didn't even have to countersteer as much as I thought I would. To me, this is like playing Guitar Hero and telling your friends you know how to play guitar. Call me crazy what does drift mode take the fun out of drifting?
*Conclusions*
Overall it's tough to gauge which one is better. The RS feels undeniably quicker, tighter, and more responsive. It tingles and talks to you. It feels like my old Focus RS, like an Escort Cosworth, it has that RS magic. All of those, are qualities which are very desirable in a sports car. But where the RS feels utterly serious, the Mustang feels special in its own way. For lack of a better word, it’s more fun. In fact pound for pound, it’s probably one of the most immature and fun cars you can buy today.
The RS makes you grip the wheel, look out at the road with a steely gaze and say ‘I’ve got this.’ The Mustang, makes you want to roll the window down and do donuts with your tongue hanging out of your mouth yelling ‘USA!’. It’s up to you which of those appeal more to you. But it is remarkable that out of those two, the light blue sparkly car with the gaudy interior and the popping exhaust feels like the grown-up. That’s how much of a child the Mustang is.
The bottom line is, that the RS had to be cleverly engineered, with modes, pops and gimmicks, to put a wig on its serious haircut, and become a laugh rather than just a competent track weapon. The Mustang, never cut its hair in the first place. It’s still hanging out in the back of its van, listening to Zeppelin. And honestly, that sounds like a pretty cool place to be. 
But come track day, I’ll look longingly at the guy in the RS, knowing that as much as I’m having a laugh, he is going faster than I am. 
Either way, it’s a good year to be a Ford fan.",2
"Japan Rental Car Adventures featuring Nissan R34 Skyline GT-R, Daihatsu Move
Hi r/cars!
Just got back from a grad trip in Japan, where I spent two weeks touring around the country. More importantly for you guys, I also rented a R34 Skyline GT-R for two days and a Daihatsu Move kei car for a day to drive around the mountains, cities and expressways. Generally speaking, the rentals were fairly straightforward to set up, the roads weren’t too hard to adjust to, and the cars were both a ton of fun. I’ll break down each car in its own sub-post review, so feel free to ask if you have any questions!
TLDR; drove a R34 GT-R and a Daihatsu Move kei car in Japan. Both were a ton of fun and easy to set up. Mountain roads in Japan are super fun, expressways are nice too but expensive. Cost for the GT-R was around 75k yen for two days (45k rental, 15k gas, 15k tolls) and cost for the Move was around 13k for a day (8k rental, 2500 yen gas, 2500 in tolls). Definitely worth it :D

"Cadilac CTS-V Wagon Overzelous Side Curtain Airbag Deployment
I wanted to wait till I got everything sorted out and got my car back before posting the full story about this. Basically I attended a SoCal V club car control clinic event with my Wagon on December 2015 at the Willow Springs Balcony. It was pretty neat for Cadillac to organize such an event so of course I joined in. Turns out one of the new marketing guys from Cadillac was also there to help show support for the event.
The morning started normal with a simple braking exercise. I had heard of stories of curtain airbags on the wagons going off in some cts-v wagons during autocross, but nothing crazy was going on yet, so I didn't bother pulling the airbag fuses (like I had done at a previous streets of willow track day). During the first exercise, while driving back in line, I make a left turn and the rear tire lost a tiny bit of traction going at approx 20-30mph. Suddenly I feel like I ran into something and the side airbags deploy. Of course it's a giant black lake of asphalt so there is nothing to hit. I'm just glad I was wearing a helmet at the time and in a controlled environment, otherwise it would have been much more dangerous. People heard the noise but assumed it was an exhaust backfire or something. Everyone was shocked to learn that the airbags had gone off since everyone witnessed what caused it.
[Video of the moment]
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Udr1SD1-zRk)
The headliner was completely ruined and the seatbelts had to be replaced as well as a bunch of trim on the inside. To the credit to the organizers they encouraged me to cut the airbags and try to make the most out of the day (which I did) and still had a good amount of fun. The Cadillac rep promised he would work to try to make things right and to his credit he did. They did the right thing and ended up covering the cost of the repair
[Outside](http://i.imgur.com/Zb32auq.jpg) | 
[Inside](http://i.imgur.com/hFD6mX2.jpg)
Anyway the dealership experience wasn't the greatest at getting repairs done. They originally freaked me by calling back and saying I needed to contact my insurance.A quick e-mail to the Cadillac rep fixed that issue. The repair took a couple of weeks (which was understandable given the frequency of cts-v wagon parts) and would have cost around $6k total. So after 3 weeks (was out of town for a week). I'll break down the next parts into visits
Revisit 1: I went to pick up the car. The brand new headliner was dirty, the moonroof trim was loose, and the C pillar trim didn't fit snug. So I called back and they told me to bring it in the next morning. I brought it in and then said there was some communication error and the interior guy was on vacation (thanks for the heads up?).
[Loose Moonroof Trim Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMZhyFHQTSE)
Revisit 2:The following week I brought it in when the interior guy returned and he fixed the issue in the morning and they cleaned it up a bit, though not totally. He said he could not fix the C pillar trim to fit perfectly because it was not a part that was replaced.
[C Pillar](http://i.imgur.com/tQsaNhn.jpg)
Revisit 3: After bringing it home I realized that the backlight on my steering wheel controls, my visor lights, one of the trunk lights weren't working. I brought it back again and left it there for them to fix.  Also they would clean the headliner a bit better this time
[Doh Lights](http://i.imgur.com/B4EpaEm.jpg) | 
[Doh Doh Lights](http://i.imgur.com/umVlwif.jpg)
Revisit 4: I came back a few days after to pick it up and instantly upon picking it up I noticed the trunk light was fixed but the visor lights and backlight were still broken. I talked to the tech who told me it was working he last worked on it... but he apologized to me which was nice (the **FIRST** apology I got since I brought the car in) So once again I leave the car there Also the tech left his screwdriver and my battery compartment open. Not a big deal but.... 
Revisit 5: I came back to pick up the car, lights look good. Unfortunately the XM radio is showing ""check antenna"" now. Sigh... 
Revisit 6: This Saturday I go, everything seems like it is fixed finally but I haven't driven the car that much since then. Fingers crossed, but happy to have it back.
Anyway in conclusion This is not the only case of this happening. The vehicle is very low volume and there are 6 similar incidents I've heard of

There may be more?  I had heard of these before, but once I experienced how easily they go off, I have to admit I'm a bit spooked. I suspect it has to do with the Stabilitrak Competitive Mode (turns off TRC but has a bit of ESC) and the airbag sensors tuned for the sedan (which has less body roll than the wagon.) They took the blackbox so hopefully they figure out a fix, because I find the whole thing to be a safety hazard if it happened on the road. However this is GM and we all know how that ignition switch incident went...
**TLDNR: Curtain Airbags on CTS-V Wagon deployed when they should not have. Has happened to multiple cars on a low volume vehicle. Dealership required 7 visits or so to do a proper fix. Happy Cadillac did the right thing but would like to see core issue fixed (and maybe the dealership experience too).**
[Anyway I'll end with this happy picture of fun that occurred way later in the day after the airbag deployment.]

"Has anyone else noticed how cheap used EVs and serial hybrids are now?
i mean shoot, 2013 Leafs are down under 12 grand. 2013 models got LiPo batteries for 120 mile range. There are some leaf taxis around the world ticking past 150k miles and they still have like 98% battery capacity left.
use volts are getting cheap as well
and by all accounts these things cost basically nothing to run, because they dont break and the ""fuel costs"" are something like 10% of gasoline.
how long until these are the gold standard of cheap transport?",2

I know it means keeping a car for as long as you can, but how do you know when the wheels have ""fallen off""?  Literally wait for the car to break down and leave you on the side of the road? If the engine and/or transmission is starting to show issues, would you even bother having it looked at? How many repair$ do you make if the car's now only worth $1-2k? When do you find the next car to ""run into the ground"", if you don't really want to end up on the side of the road?",2
"Help: Mazda RX8, 2008. Check engine came on and inital diagnosis of cylinder 1 misfire. Mazda garage is quoting over £2000 to repair details below
Basically the engine was making weird sound and check engine light was on.  The RAC break down guy ran a diagnosis on the road and he said first cylinder was misfiring. So I got towed to nearest mazda garage. 
The garage has come back with the following:
 * 2 ignition coils ~£275
 * O/S engine mount  ~ £266
 * Catalyst  & exhaust breaking up ~£1500
I don't know how to deal with this.  Obviously I don't have over 2000 lying around for car repair or anything for that matter.  I don't know if these are reasonable charges.  I was planning to replace the car anyway latest Q1 of next year.  It has the Mot due end of February so... basically if it failed mot I would be looking at replacing the car any way. 
Do the quoted values sound reasonable? Or even relevant to initial failure? I know the  coils definitely are so will need to replace those.

"Have you ever heard of a dealership service center unable to break a bolt to do a front-end alignment requiring up to $1,800 to replace a rack and pinion?
I tried to take my car (2006 Prius) in for an alignment yesterday and it went down very strangely. I recently got the tires replaced. The previous owner had put mismatched tires on the front and they were wearing unevenly so it was a long-time coming. I do the majority of my own maintenance and when I do have to take a car in I usually avoid the dealership. But I don't have equipment to do a precise alignment and I had a good coupon for service at this dealership with a rental. It's routine maintenance so what could go wrong? A lot, apparently.
I got a call from the service manager saying they couldn't break a bolt to do the alignment on the left front wheel. It seems strange that a service center at a large dealership couldn't manage to get a bolt loose. He told me they'd have to completely disassemble the tow hook assembly at a cost of $580. Then he told me that if they couldn't break the bolt after disassembling the tow hook that it would cost $1,800 to replace the rack and pinion.
Maybe I'm overestimating my car knowledge but none of this sounds right. The guy said they did the right side but without being able to do the other side it was slightly out of alignment. Then he handed me [this chart](https://i.imgur.com/S5908F7.jpg) which in my not-so-expert opinion makes it look like they made it worse. My engine also seems to want to turn on much earlier and my gas mileage seems to have taken a hit which would indicate additional resistance at the tires.
I know you can do a rough alignment at home quite easily. I'm going to get under the car and follow the steps to do a basic alignment this weekend but I don't have the time to muck with my car for a while. Am I just being ignorant and they were possibly being completely honest? Should I bother trying to break the bolt to do an alignment myself? Regardless, I'm going to take it to my usual little shop to and ask them to do an alignment to see what happens. Any advice is appreciated.",2
"How many brands make legitimately unreliable cars nowadays?
Hi everyone, 
I was just thinking about some of my friends who are Chevy fanboys, and whenever something is wrong with my Mustang they are always like ""damn Fords"" or ""Shoulda got a Chevy!"" 
Like okay, listen, the car is from 2001, it's 17 years old and it wasn't too good of a time for Ford, but in this day and age, we've come a long ways in reliability. Now, to bring that Chevy fanboy stuff back around, I don't think that they can say the new GT350 is any more reliable or unreliable than the new Camaro.     
So basically, are there any companies that make unreliable piles of garbage that break down every thousand miles anymore?",2
"A car means more when you build it yourself, and it has an interesting story...
A person told me to post my story here. After it blew up on the r/mustang sub, I'm new here so sorry if I break any unwritten rules or something!!
Here it is: 
Around 11 years ago my grandfather 
promised me he would buy me an old mustang. This promise was upheld in the summer of 2010 as we found our first pony car in Raleigh, North Carolina. It was a sight to see, a rotten, blue, rusted, classic pony car sitting in the dirt. After getting the mustang out of the dirt. My grandfather decided that we should take her home. We only had a tow dolly, and as we were going down the interstate, the axle snapped. Sadly, we would have to leave the car for a few weeks. As those weeks went by we got a call from my grandfather's brother saying the car was stolen. I was devastated, and my grandfather assumed it had been sold for scrap. 
One year later, as my grandfather was driving by an old barn, out of the corner of his eye he spotted a creamy yellow car, and it happened to be a 1966 Soft Top Mustang. The car ran, but had a blown head gasket, as it puffed smoke everywhere. 
Over the past 4 years my grandfather and I have shared the experience of restoring this beauty. I've learned a lot as I am now 16 years old, and totally different from the first picture in the gallery. I hope you enjoy this cool story about my car, as I plan to keep people updated on the build. 
And yes it is mine! I've learned a lot and by no means am I some spoiled child, I've had to work a lot for parts and such. But none of this could be possible without my grandpa 
Hope you enjoyed the long-ish read!

"Progressive returned my car with mechanical damages. What should I do?
Okay this is going to be long.
I was in a minor fender bender at school. Someone backed in to me and bent the sheet metal on my door in a parking lot. I filed a claim with their insurance and they agree to fix it after 3 days of ""investigating"". I drop it off at their service center on day 4. I drove the car during the 3 days because it only had cosmetic damage to the front door, I even drove it to their shop for drop-off. They give me a rental and I expect all to be good.
A week later I get a call that my car is ready. I go over to pick it up and see that their paint job is really bad with SEVERE orange peeling on their clear coat. I politely point it out. They acknowledge it and promise to fix it. I drove off in the rental sad that I don't get my car back. 
Another week passes and I get a call that my car is ready. Boy, I'm excited to get my baby back. I inspect their work when I arrive. They still did a shoddy job on the a-piller with the clear coat. No big deal I just want my car back. I decide I can live with that imperfection and decide to drive off. Except when I get in my car it has a CEL. Weird that wasn't there before. I let them know right away and they say they'll make note of it. I drive off and feel a slight vibration. Weird, tires were rotated and balanced about a month ago. No big deal, I'll just get them balanced again tomorrow. I get up to 40 mph and the car start droning really loud and vibrating like I'm driving on a washboard. Okay something is wrong. I drive back and let them know. I was a little upset but polite the entire time. Supervisor on duty agrees to go on test ride with me. He acknowledged the severe vibration and noise and immediately gets defensive. Again I remain polite. He agrees to take a look back at the service center. There he tells me he sees nothing wrong and that my car is simply old and prone to random failure. At that point he raises his voice and tells me that he won't entertaining the idea of his shop damaging the car and that I need to stop accusing them of it. I point out that I have not made any accusations, I'm simply letting them know about my concerns with the condition of the car. He raises his voice and goes on a rant about how I'm accusing him. I let him blow his steam. When he paused I interrupted and asked if I could see the check-in paperwork. He says he can't do that. I don't believe him. I ask again and he says ""i'll see but I doubt I can"".
He disappears into the back. I tell his desk staff that he is being rude and if they can help me get a copy of the paperwork. They politely oblige. I like his front desk staff, they maintain mutual respect as I speak with them. At this point the supervisor comes back and says there was three different codes for O2 sensors and that he cleared them. I din't ask him to. The check-in sheet confirms that there were no fault codes in the dash the day I checked in. He goes on about how my car is old and things just break and that's not his problem. He tells me to take it to my mechanic and get it fixed. He refuses to help me any further.
 They are now closed for business and they want me out of there. I reluctantly drive home in my car at 30 mph where the vibrations are bearable.
I get out of my car and smell burnt brakes. Walk over and inspect the rear end and notice that one wheel is extremely hot and that rotor looks glazed. Seized caliper was my immediate thought. I decide not to drive the car anymore. 
What should I do? There was a CEL that I never got to get diagnosed because the guy cleared the codes. I din't even get to see what the codes were because he cleared them without my knowledge. The car vibrates really bad from the rear end when it didn't before I dropped it off. The check-in paperwork indicates none of these problems were present when they took it in. The y refuse to help any further saying it is unrelated to the accident and is just normal mechanical failure. i don't know what to do. I know cars break down on their own but I wasn't expecting to get my car back with CEL's, a seized caliper, and rear-end vibration so bad that the car is undriveable. I agree with him that the mechanical faults are unrelated to the accident. I know because I drove the car in to their shop and there was zero vibration and CEL's.  What is starnge to me is that there is so much wrong with the car mechanically when I pick it up at their shop after two weeks. Is there anything I can do or am i stuck with towing to a shop and paying for the repairs?
If it matters the car is an 06 Infiniti G35 6MT.
TL;DR: Progressive fixes minor damage to front door. Car is returned with CEL's, a seized rear caliper, and SEVERE rear end vibration. Service center refused to help and showed me the door.",2

"Got into the first car crash for which I was at fault :/ Just need to rant a little...
So today I was at fault in a car accident. I’m not a bad driver, I swear it was an accident. At least I was actively trying to avoid it from happening the whole time, but I panicked.  
**Backstory**
I went out to grab lunch during my lunch hour. I have to wear dress shoes to work, these happened to have a wooden sole with rubber inserts. While getting into my car I had to step through a puddle. I jumped into the car and shook the shoes off outside I best I could. 
Pulling up to the exit of the parking lot, I wait my turn to turn right.  It's a horrible exit, steep cutoffs, steep incline up, sidewalk, steep incline down, it seems like 1.5-2 feet in each direction and a steep storm water drain trough at the bottom of the street. The car in front of me exits, and I stop half way up the incline in order to not block the sidewalk. After waiting,I see a break in the traffic, I make my move... But I stall finishing going “uphill”. Ugh! Quick restart sequence! Glancing over, traffic is still a block away and their traffic-light just changed green.  Rev, clear the incline. Slowdown over sidewalk and the bottom of the incline and halfway out into the street, steering wheel straight, I STALL. Traffic is half a block away, I throw on the hazard lights because I’m partially in the street.
**Where I panic**
I'm panicking in my head, I’m afraid someone won’t notice my car and is going to T-Bone me (in retrospect this would not have happened by a long shot). Power steering is off. The incline is placing most of the weight of the car onto the front wheels, which are in a drainage trough. The wheel is barely turing D:  Traffic slows down *sigh of relief* 
**How the accident happens**
I mash the clutch and  manage to start the car, but my foot slips…Remember the wooden sole and the puddle? In my haste, I didn’t line up my shoe dead-center with the clutch pedal. The only physical contact point between the metal & rubber of the clutch pedal and my shoe was the wet edge of wooden sole…goodbye friction. With the clutch fully depressed and the car in gear, my foot slips off the clutch and it shot straight up with my left foot underneath.  Car in gear, my other foot on the gas, the car lurches forward into the intersection. I cross the lines, turning the steering wheel as fast as I could, but alas. I was sticking too far out, someone in the other lane did not see me and our bumper’s collided at 5-10 mph.
**Why I feel bad**
I’ve never been at fault for a crash before today. I’ve been cut off, almost run off the road, and all sorts of crazy shenanigans only Miami driver’s could come up with, but I've never been at fault. At least the damage is contained to both bumpers.
It’s been MONTHS since I’ve stalled my car, like September of last year :/ I though up to this point I was rather proficient in preventing this from happening.*sigh* Ultimately though, it was a cluster fuck on my end. 
Just a tip I’m going to live by, if your shoes are wet, be **extremely** careful with your clutch pedal. Also, don't panic, it does absolutely nothing to help your situation. Deep breath and carry on.
I feel really bad for the guy I crashed into, he had just gotten his car not a month ago, he just replaced the temporary tag! Also, he was driving with an ""International License"", the cop said it didn't exist and gave him a $500 fine. My ticket for crossing the lanes was only $179.  *I’m truly sorry.*
On the plus side, the damage to both cars does not look that bad. Maybe I’ll have to replace the grill and the number cover. Hopefully nothing else was involved. His car looks to be in worse shape, but at least the headlight assembly wasn’t cracked, just he bumper and front quarter panel.
Thanks Reddit for allowing me a place to rant and get this off my chest. I’m a good driver I swear! 
tl;dr
Wet shoes and clutch pedal do not go well together. I stalled my car going through the steep exit of parking lot, panicked, and allowed my foot to slip off the clutch, launching me into traffic :/ Not fun

"How to drive in winter weather
With the new winter storm in the NorthEast and the foul weather really starting to pick up
I wanted to pass along some winter weather driving tips from a lifelong NorthEasterner.  It goes without saying - if you don't have to drive in the bad weather, don't (Thanks /u/zillah1985 !)
I encourage everyone who has additional tips to comment and I will make my best effort to
edit them in.
**If you only take two things away from this, let them be this:**
* Slow down
* Make movements SLOWLY and deliberately. Do not make jerky sudden movements.
With no further adieu,
**Overarching:**
* Slow down. Speed limits are for prime conditions.  It doesn't make you less of a person to slow down and ensure your and everyone else's safety. Just do it.
* Make only VERY deliberate movements.  Make them slowly.
* When switching lanes, if you usually do a 45 degree angle, do it at 15. This makes it less likely that you will “catch an edge,” loose control or veer off the road.
* Use your blinkers, and leave them on for longer than usual before making your move. This allows people behind and around you to adjust their driving to allow you in. (See / stopping braking)
* When turning onto a side road, do not make a 90 degree turn.  Make a wider turn if possible to prevent you from sliding sideways.
* Be hyper aware of other people on the road. Know that they face the same conditions as you.  They will have trouble stopping if you suddenly pull out in front of them.
* Turn on your lights. Even if it doesn’t help you see, it will help others see you.
* Be patient.  There will be people that are driving way slower than you think they should. You don't know what their circumstances are. They could have bald tires, an alignment issue that makes the more prone to slippage or any other number of things.
* Highways are usually better taken care of than side roads. You may want to take the highway even if it usually doesn’t make sense to in a normal circumstance.
* Try to avoid hilly areas if possible.
* Try to stick to main roads as they are likely to be better plowed and salted
* Stay in the tire tracks of other cars.  Not only will you have better traction, but for every person that does this, the more traction it gives everyone else by tamping down the snow and in some cases melting / pushing it aside.
* Don’t ride parallel to other cars. Everyone ends up sliding a little bit in this weather, and it’s likely to cause an accident.
* The day after a storm or a melt can be just as dangerous as the day of the storm - sometimes more so.  Be especially careful after a warm day followed by a cold night. The snow will likely have melted during the day, then re-froze over night, making everything extremely slippery as it’s covered in black ice.
* Only pass if completely necessary, and do so with extreme caution. Don’t try to gun it to go around someone, you will likely lose control of your car. Do it slowly and deliberately. Try to minimize the amount of time you are riding parallel to the car you are passing.
* SUV drivers - you might have 4WD, but the weight of your vehicle makes it much harder to stop. Just because you have traction driving does not mean you are going to be able to stop or wont slide on a turn, or won’t catch an edge. Adjust your driving accordingly.
* Clear all the snow off your car. Even the roof.  It can not only slide off the back and injure someone / break someone’s windshield, but it can also slide forward cover the windshield, effectively blinding you. Take the extra 2 minutes and just do it.
* Look as far ahead as you can so you can pre-empt any obstacles or obstructions ahead. (Thanks /u/dajohnnyboy !)
**Turning:**
* Only pull out when there is more than enough room for you to do so, do not think other people will be able to brake to give you room to pull out. They will likely slide into you.
* Make your turns wider. 90 degree turns (especially at higher speeds) can make you slide sideways and this is very hard to get out of, and sometimes leads to fishtailing.
* Look before you turn. Assess if you can make it down the road before actually going.  Sometimes streets are not yet plowed. If you don’t think you can make it down that road, go around if possible.
* Do not accelerate into a turn. Or brake while turning (Thanks /u/pregunta_tonta !). You will likely slide or fishtail.
**Stopping:**
* Leave lots of extra room in front of you. If you usually drive 3 car lengths, leave 10.  There is no guarantee your brakes are going to stop your car. Many cars turn into sleds in the snow and ice.
* Brake lightly, Do not slam on your brakes. This will just make you slide.
* Do not rely on your brakes. Whenever possible, come off the gas instead of braking. Especially at high speeds and on the highways.
* Do not think you will be able to stop on a hill. Many times you won’t be able to.
* Test your brakes way far back before you actually have to stop. If you are sliding, come completely off the gas, and try to stop with small light brakes. If you still can’t stop, leave yourself enough time to avoid whatever you are braking for. Do this deliberately and use your blinkers. If you are going into an intersection make sure you use your horn to alert other drivers you are not able to stop. You might want to also throw your hazards on here too, but this is a low priority; make sure you avoid a dangerous situation first and foremost.
**Highway Driving:**
* Go slow.  Not 15 miles an hour slow, but 10-20 MPH under the speed limit is usually sufficient. Go whatever speed you feel safe and in complete control of your car.
* Try to stick to the middle lane and stay in the tracks of other cars. This way if you slide, you will still be on the road.
* Do not rapidly switch lanes, do so very gradually and deliberately.  Use your blinker, and allow enough time with your blinker on before you go for those around you to adjust their driving to allow you in.
* Don’t use the high speed lane if possible. Usually this lane is completely covered in snow, and it’s right by the edge of the road. If you catch an edge in this lane (which is much more likely given the snow), you are at much higher risk of going off the road.
**Avoiding getting stuck:**
* Try not to stop on hills - going up or down.
* If you have to stop at a stop sign, do not stop all the way if possible. Keep a little bit of a roll to your car. It’s much harder to go from a dead stop than it is when you have some momentum.  Leave lots of extra room in front of you at a stop light so you can roll very slowly.
* Don’t try to power through high snow. Not only will you likely get stuck, you can mess up your car.
* Use a lower gear if possible. Higher gears increase tire RPM and you need more torque to get you out, otherwise your tires end up spinning.
**Getting Unstuck:**
* Try backing up. Usually the snow behind your tires is already tamped down, so you should have some traction.  Once you’ve backed up get a little bit of speed to get through whatever obstacle has you stuck
* Rock it. Back up, go forward, as many times as you need to get enough tamped down snow to get some traction and get through.  Don’t be rough on your transmission, though. Be sure to give it enough time to switch from forward to reverse.
* Push it. If you’re alone, you can open your driver door, and push on the frame of the car while still being available to turn the wheel if you need to.
* Throw some sand and / or salt under your tires (see Equipment).  Pairing this with the rocking method will get you out of almost everything. Kitty litter is awesome for this too! (thanks /u/duckisscary !)
* Consider taking out your floor mats and putting them under the tire. This might give you the traction you need to get moving again. (thanks /u/732 !)
* Enable all wheel / four wheel drive if you car is equipped with this.
* Know what kind of drive train you have. Front Wheel Drive, Rear wheel drive, or Four / All Wheel drive.  Focus on getting the tires the car moves on unstuck and your car will move again.
* Use a lower gear if possible. (edit: This is debatable, there have been a lot of comments on this one. I've seen it work in some circumstances, but it shouldn't necessarily be your go to. Just moved it to the bottom of the list here.)
**Getting out of a skid / slide:**
* Skidding and sliding in the snow is very similar to hydroplaning. The same rules apply.
* To avoid skidding or sliding, make slow deliberate movements and do not brake suddenly.
1. Don’t panic.
2. Come off the gas
3. Align your wheels to the direction you are sliding
4. Make slight adjustments to your heading to bring yourself back on course. Do not make a sudden turn, as this will continue the skid OR cause you to fishtail which can turn into a spinout.
5. Once you’re back on course, resume acceleration, slowly.
**Equipment:**
* Tires. I can’t stress this enough. Preferably winter tires, but all weather tires work very well too.  At the very least just make sure your ties have tread. Bald tires will at the very least get you stuck in the snow, and at the worst cause you to crash.
* A good scraper.  They sell extendable ones too with brushes which makes it much easier to get snow off the roof.
* Sand / Salt.  This is awesome to keep in the trunk of your car.  It serves a dual purpose it adds weight to a light part of your car, giving you better traction, and you can also use it under your tires in case you get stuck.
* Extra warm things - Put an extra hat, pair of gloves, and a blanket in your car. Maybe even a sweater / fleece / sweatshirt.  If you break down in the snow you will be thankful for it.
**Notes:**
* When referring to ""coming off the gas,"" don't just yank your foot off the gas, ease off it.  (thanks /u/donutpop365 !)",2
"""Luxury"" cars: what holds up the best in the long run? Audi, Lexus, BMW?
I totaled my 06 Civic the other day. Decided it's time to upgrade. Looking at a pre-owned Audi (A4 or A5), Lexus (IS250), or maybe a BMW (328i). 
I've heard mixed things about what costs the most for repairs, upkeep, and what breaks down the most. Trying to get a lot of input before I make a big decision. Or if anyone has any recommendations for something I can find for less than 28k pre-owned.

"I autocrossed my E36 M3 for the first time in nearly 3 years. It went well, very well. (Video in post)
A lot of you guys probably remember my car as the [""RegularCarReviews E36""](http://i.imgur.com/W3XDpts.jpg), and you'll probably also remember it was half-broken at the time of that video with a busted steering rack and the wrong tires on it.
That's more or less been the theme of the car for the past several years, I fell out of autocrossing/tracking because something was always broken or threatening to break on the car. The car still has a tired heart, I need to swap or rebuild the motor this winter, but at least I've got the chassis completely sorted out now. Anyway, I had a fire in my loins to hoon on the car so I brought it out of retirement for an Autocrossers Inc. event in Waldorf MD. It was a double event with 4 runs in the morning, then 4 in the afternoon with the course reversed. 
I started out very gingerly and posted a time of 57s on my first run, then shaved it down to around 50s by my fourth. The first run of the afternoon I ran a similar time, then something snapped and I started driving the car like it owed me money, slept with my girlfriend and ran over my cat. For the last three runs I completely overdrove the tires, pretty much constantly in the gray fuzzy area between being fast and losing control. 
The best time I posted was 48.2, which was about 3 seconds off the fastest M3 in my class who was running 180TW ultra high performance tires against my 330TW summer street tires. They say good tires are worth about 2 seconds, so I'm pretty thrilled with my times. 
Here is the video of my fastest run. The camera is a GoPro Hero3+ mounted on the front bumper running a VidPro external mic mounted on the heat shield of the air intake. In retrospect, I wish I had mounted the camera on the rear quarter panel and/or mounted the mic on the rear bumper near the exhaust, you would've been able to see the car rotating more and heard the tires being tortured. But oh well, the induction sound is pretty gnarly too. :D

"Luckiest break of my life, all thanks to a mutual passion. Thought I'd share and see if anyone else has had a similar experience. (Warning: sorta long)
[Let me just say sorry for how long this is, but I felt like shorter version doesn't explain the situation very well, and I like tell stories.]
I usually have terrible luck, but last week I got lucky beyond my wildest imagination. 
I worked late and got off at 2am and when I got home my fiancé and I decided we were hungry so we should drive to get some cookout over by my work. Well the one we went to closed right as we got there so we decided to try another location we knew stayed open till 4 am. So I ended up getting on the interstate connector into the city as it was the fastest route. 
I drive this strip of interstate from the city 5 miles back and forth to work everyday and some nights when I work late, the roads are barren on the drive home so I can get on it it pretty good without issues and I've learned over time where cops like to post up. So that night I decided as we were going down the on ramp that I was gonna stretch the legs a bit and I started rifling through the gears till I hit around 135 in about a quarter of a mile or so and then I let off and coasted in neutral cause I knew that cops liked to hide about another half mile or so up the road around another bend. Well as I came around the first bend close to an exit with an overpass, guess who was sitting just behind the exit? A fucking state trooper (which is what the state police are called here), and my heart dropped into my stomach. I looked over at my fiancé and told her that I might be going to jail. 
As predicted, he pulled out, lit up the blue lights and I pulled over. When he got to my window, he asked ""So, do you know how fast you were going?"" At this moment in time, I was using what I thought was the only way I might be able to get out of being cuffed: my speedometer needle had been stuck on 30 because I have a backlight gauge cluster overlay and the adhesive spray I used when I put it in shrinks enough to hold the needle when it's pretty cold. I answered him with ""Was it just above 90?"" He laughed and said ""you were doing 90 by the time I pulled out."" I then pointed to my cluster and said well honestly sir, I dont know how fast I was going because my speedometer is stuck on 30."" He leaned over and looked in and saw it and stood straight up and let out a laugh exclaiming ""Oh man, really? Wow."" I laughed a little myself and looked over at my fiancé who was grabbing my paperwork, thinking that maybe this was gonna save me from being thrown in the back of his squad car. But I was wrong. What happened next was the real life saver. He says ""Well, I clocked you doing 114 and the speed limit here is 60."" In my head I was like ""Fuck, 54 over, I'm toast..."" 
Then the cop took a step back and said, ""Is this a 40th anniversary?"" I responded ""No sir, it's the 35th anniversary Roush stage 2."" He then says ""This is nice. I had a 02 GT for a while but I sold it and recently just bought a 2014 5.0."" I said ""Wow congrats, that must be a real blast to drive. I'm sure you have plenty of fun it it."" He he answers ""Yeah I've been enjoying it, it's definitely a step up from the 02. Well let me take your paper work and get that checked out."" So I hand over my credentials and he goes back to his squad car. The next 10 minutes seemed like an hour as I sat thinking about how this, at the very least, 6 point ticket and massive fine was going to possibly suspend my license and bankrupt me. 
When the trooper got back, he handed me my papers and license and says ""Ok well, I dropped this down as far as I could go for ya. I wrote you as doing 69 in a 60 and the fine is 76$ and 2 points on your license."" 
I was fucking dumbstruck. 
I'm sure my mouth was probably gaping wide open without me even realizing it and he handed me the ticket. He then says, ""I circled what I clocked you at on there next to what I cited you for and if you want you can go to court on the date listed there and contest it if you want or you can pay it online."" I looked up at him and said, ""I can't thank you enough for your understanding and I really appreciate you doing this for me."" And then I shook his hand and he said ""You take care of the 'stang and don't let it get you into trouble. I know a lot of guys I work with would have cuffed you on the spot."" I assured him I wasn't going to be doing anything other than the speed limit for a long time and that I'll be frequenting the strip when I have the itch. The last thing he said was, ""Well just in case, be careful because there's a good bit of us out here patrolling right now. Y'all have a good night."" And the he walked back and got into his car. 
I honestly can't believe how lucky I was. Lucky enough to be pulled over by a guy who was all around a great person but also ended up being a mustang fan himself. He cut me the cheapest ticket I've ever had, even after it being reduced by a judge.
I've had cops be massive assholes to me such as one who pulled me doing the previously posted speed limit through a non active construction zone on a 4 lane highway telling me that the speed limit drops to from 50 to 35 there and that I could have potentially killed someone when there wasn't even anyone working or even equipment there, just the orange barrels. 
Maybe I've just had bad luck with cops, but the one time it really could have been bad, the car gods smiled on me. 
TL;DR: Got pulled over by state police while doing 114 in a 60, only cited me for doing 69 in a 60 with a 76$ fine and 2 points because he ended up being a mustang/car enthusiast himself, not to mention just a nice guy in general. 
Any of you out there have some even better stories? 
EDIT: Ok, so, I understand it would been better if I hadn't done it. I understand how if there had actually been another car was on the road I could have endangered them. I understand that if a meteor had crashed into the straight 4 lane road I was on 100 feet in front of me I wouldn't have been able to stop in time and that I would have had go around it to avoid it which could have put me and my passenger in a dangerous position. But I ask everyone to understand that this is not something I do at regular intervals. This was the first time in over a year that I have broken the speed limit by more than 10 miles an hour. And the first time in about 4 years I have been over 100. I did not drive at 135 for a sustained period. Once I saw 135 I immediately let off and I wasn't above the speed limit for more than 15-20 seconds. No one else was on the road for a fact. If there had been I wouldn't have tried it because I don't speed around others unless it's anywhere from 5-10 over for passing and changing lanes. Also I wouldn't risk it because someone could call me in and my car sticks out like a sore thumb. I've never been in an accident and have never been cited for doing more than 12 over. The state trooper decided that I should get a break for some reason and that reason was probably because I wasn't a threat to anyone else and that he maybe saw a little of himself in me. I can only guess. In the end, my fiancé and I were just enjoying my car and happened to make a wrong assumption. Never really thought anyone on this sub would wish for me to go to prison, lose my car, my license and even my life. But I believe that most of those people didn't read the whole story and are making assumptions about how it all happened and circumstances. It's cool that you all have a high level of respect for the laws and the safety of others as well as the unpredictability of life. It just seems a little odd to me that car enthusiasts have never done anything like this once in their life. That's being said, sorry to piss some of you off but my fiancé and I are  alive and well, I have my license, my car and no one else was injured, placed in harms way, or even witnessed this catastrophe. I'm sorry for upsetting so many of you, especially anyone who isn't American, and can't identify with the way car enthusiasts where I'm from like to enjoy their cars. Needless to say, i have a ticket to pay and I won't be doing this again, I simply can't risk it. ",2
"I got to test drive a new Fiat 124 Spider yesterday. My thoughts within.
Hi all, I went to my local international auto show (Nashville) 
While my test drive was short, about 15 minutes, I got to experience full throttle in the car. While this is an ND Miata underneath the 124 has a nicer interior, and personally I think the exterior proportions are great in person.
So because this was an auto show, the car was an Automatic, heresy I know, but the whole ""yeah I can drive a stick"" guy would break it immediately if they brought that car.
**Driving Impressions** 
Steering: Excellent direct steering, quick, light, and a ton of feedback! Best EPS car I've driven. 
Brakes: They are firm and haul it down quickly.
Acceleration: There is no one home below 3500RPM with the 1.4 MultiAir. Once boost kicks in it goes pretty quick, I was able to go full throttle on city backstreets without breaking the law...*too much* 
Transmission: I have not driven the manual version of this car, cannot comment on that. Transmission does have a manual mode, no paddles in the Lusso trim, manual mode is quick and in the proper order (Pull to upshift, push to downshift) blips on downshift as well! Very smooth in Drive as well. It does have a ""kick down switch"" at the bottom of the pedal travel for extra speed. Overall, very good for a traditional torque converter automatic.
Ride Quality: Controlled, a little jittery on city streets but overall it was pretty comfortable.
**Interior**
Design: Overall design is very nice, everything is where you would want it to be. It has knobs to control HVAC, I did not play around in the touch screen for the radio, but it doesn't look bad.
Interior Quality: Materials were nice, buttons weren't ""clacky"" feeling, it has soft touch material on the doors and dashboard, leather steering wheel is nice to hold. Seats are comfortable, but tight. Nice fabric on them as well. No cowl shake from the top either. Well screwed together(thanks Mazda.) 
**Final Impressions** 
Fun little car, definitely not fast, but not slow either. Great cruiser. Looks good, feels good. However, if you are any taller than 5'10"" you will not fit very comfortably if you have long legs, I had plenty of headroom though. It is very tight in that sense, I am about 5'10"" and 180lbs and the seat was snug on me, Legroom was less that I would have hoped for. Long legs beware.
If I were in the market, I'd buy the manual version of this car over the Mazda. I'd love to see how it drives with the top down on some back roads!
Edit: the downvotes are real in the comments, both mine and others, is that really necessary?",2
"This is why you should get your timing belt changed
Well, this wasn't actually caused by a broken timing belt, but the same would happen if it was.
Background story:
So, I actually got this engine from my former English teacher. It's a 1.8l 125 hp engine from a 1999 VW Passat Variant. It has about 270.000 km (165,000 miles) on it, and we're not quite sure what happened. He was on vacation, going around 150 km/h (90mph) on the German Autobahn, when the engine just started losing power. No loud noises or anything. He shifted down, but it just kept losing power, and when he finally put it in neutral the engine simply stalled. He had around 800km (500 miles) back to Denmark, so that sucked.
The engine had probably been doing around 4000 rpm for quite a while, which must have caused the valves to break. It looks like the chain between the two camshafts is slightly damaged, so maybe the breaking of the valve caused the intake-camshaft to get out of timing, which broke a few other valves too. I'm not sure though.
Pictures of the whole thing [here.](http://imgur.com/a/4XVMH)
____________
EDIT: I just got a little further with the disassembling. I actually found small pieces of metal in the very bottom of the oil pan and in the air-intake system (in the throttle body - Not sure that is what it's called). So the small pieces of valve and cylinder head have traveled quite far.",2
"So I've done something a little bit unreasonable, and bought my first car.
Unreasonable because i live in pot-hole-riddled, freezing-temperatures-4-months-of-the-year, northern North America (east coast yo), yet this is what i chose to buy : http://imgur.com/a/eKHiE
It's a 1997 GTV 916. The internals hold a Busso 3 liters V6, 24 valves, naturally aspirated.
Bought it used (obviously), pre-imported from Japan, 94K kilometers on it. The car is stock, except for some aftermarket 17"" wheels and a small spoiler ; i might end up removing both.
I love : 
* The looks. Makes me grin each time i come down to the lot and see it. To say it's a head-turner is an understatement. I can't do 5 km without people giving me thumbs up or taking pictures. This was something i did not anticipate.
* The originality. I didn't strictly need a car, but the opportunity was too good. 
* The motorisation. Everything about it is great. The power isn't that high by american standards (220 hp, 270 Nm), but it's more than enough for me. Only downside is a relatively high consumption for the weight (14L / 100km on the first 1000km, car is 1400kg). The sound is divine, makes me grin each time i put the pedal down. I originally wanted it as a week-end car, but i end up taking it 2-3 times a week when weather allows, just to treat myself.
* The midget size (unless you seat in the rear). Also, the fact it has 4 seats nevertheless.
* The road feel. You feel really connected to the road.
All in all, it's close to my concept of an ideal car. The only things it lacks would be A/RWD and a 6th gear, but love is blind.
I no love : 
* The road feel. You feel *really* connected to the road. Every time i'm not on a recently paved highway, i fear the whole car is going to rattle away in pieces. Most of the time I drive 15mph in the city.
* The logistic isolation. If i break something, anything, i need to go see a hobby mechanic and have pieces sent from Europe. Between that and pot-hole mitigation speed, I end up driving really, really conservatively most of the time.
This spring i'm catching up on some maintenance and doing some future-proofing upgrades. Next spring i want to take it to a dyno and see how to bring it back to original specs. Eventually i want to take some track lessons then take it to autocross.
Was I too unreasonable ?",2
"The start of the third winter
http://i.imgur.com/om4SyM3.jpg
Born in May 1991, it has survived 25 and a half years to see it's third winter with me behind the wheel. Because of that, I had to bring it to an abandoned airfield the annual day of first snow.
Purchased in December of 2014 from a friend of the family who had inherited it from their 79 year old father who had owned it for 10 years, but passed away that year, it had 174k original kilometers on the clock, garage kept during winters because he felt unsure about taking it on snow and barely used it when it wasn't snowy.
It's been my daily for almost 2 full years now and has never let me down, towing trailers full of lumber or gravel, my dad's car that keeps breaking down and leaving him stranded, you name it 
Spent approximately 150-200€ in maintenance over this time because it just refuses to break. 
I have been checking for replacements occasionally, but I feel like I just don't want to get rid of it. I drive it every day and it has become my car in more than just the ownership kind of way.
Either way, it took it's annual snowy airfield thrashing like a champ. 
I think I will end up driving it until the doors fall off. I can't think of anything I would rather have.",2
"Winter is here, What I'll miss and what I won't - C7 Grand Sport Review
Well the snow's here as I'm sure some of you have realized and some of us have begrudgingly put our toys into storage over these last few weeks. I decided it was time to look back on summer and do a review on my Corvette.
I won't talk about how I got it, options etc as I've made a separate post about that when I first got the car. I'll leave a link to that thread at the end for those interested. Also I did do the Corvette Owner's School, the link for that thread will also be at the end which includes track footage.
So after 6 1/2 months of ownership I'm left to ponder my first summer with the car and Corvette ownership. This may get a little long but I'll break it up into categories to make it easy.
**Usability**
It's true what they say, for a 2 seater car, this thing can hold a lot of shit. While you won't be bringing your new fridge home in the back (unless its a mini-fridge) I did manage to bring home a new office chair without an issue. Grocery shopping is easy, beer runs are easy. I have a cargo net and a cargo shade so I can rest easy about leaving stuff in the hatch away from prying eyes. 
The car is the perfect height off the ground. I have yet to scrape the front splitter, I don't need to angle the car when going over speed bumps and any curb that looks a little iffy to drive over to get into a parking lot is easily avoided by approach angle.
Gas mileage is tolerable in the city at about 16mpg and a great 28mpg average highway. I've hit 30mpg consistently when taking it real easy and just cruising but average about 27-28 with the occasional pedal to the floor passing etc. 
Visibility is awesome out the front. The packaging of the engine means the hood is low and angled. The car is short enough that properly adjusted mirrors tell you where everything is. The rear windshield is a bit hysterical with my spoiler but since the car's so low I can still see where the car's are behind me.
The seats are great. I've experienced both the standard seats and the Competition seats (on track), both are wonderful. I did a 6 hour road trip and never had to readjust or fidget with the standard seats. I actually really loved the Competition seats and kind of wished I had optioned those, I thought they would be a bit much since they are designed for the track but they are still very comfortable and I love the look.
**Driving**
This thing is like a big spec Miata and no I don't mean it drives like an LS swapped Miata. This car has so much grip and stopping power due to 285/30/R19's up front and 335/25/R20's in the back with 14.6 inch Brembo's in the front and 14.4inch in the rear. The car easily handles the 460hp, so much so you kinda wish it had maybe another 50-90. The car is completely trustworthy, I can barely spin the tires in first gear it hooks up so quickly.
The electric steering is pretty good, you can feel everything the front tires are doing. In low speed parking the car exhibits the Ackermann Effect due to the packaging and large tires. You feel the tires skipping across the pavement. Its totally normal but freaks out passengers who don't know about it thinking the car's broken.
On track this thing is ridiculous, this is why I said it needs another 50-90hp. It just has so much mechanical grip compared to the power. The grip this thing gives you on the standard MPSS's is nuts. I was pulling over 1G in the corners and the car didn't break a sweat, I've seen it go up to 1.2G in ride-alongs, you feel like your being thrown into the side of the car and it just keeps going, the tires never giving up. It's a confidence inspiring car, after a few laps to get my bearings and push my own limits the car still said ""is that all you got?"". 
The 8 speed automatic is a decent auto. Leaving it to its own devices results in quick seamless up-shifts in everyday driving. Flooring it on an on ramp results in some nice thunderclaps when it up-shifts higher in the rev range going 60+. Manual mode leaves something to be desired. Using the paddles results in a delayed response. If flooring it in first gear you have to upshift at around 1k shy of redline or you will bounce off the rev limiter. For this reason I tend to just leave it in auto unless I'm puttering around town and want to make some noise. Backroads are a toss up, depends how I feel. If manual mode didn't suck I would probably use it all time on back roads.
**Electronics and Systems**
The configurable DIC and HUD are nice. You can set it up to give you all your pertinent info or just have a big old tachometer and nothing else. You can see your lifetime rev's, engine hours, 0-60 times etc. 
The infotainment is functional and easy to use, very intuitive however the Corvette still currently runs off the original MyLink system and as far as I know I don't think any other GM vehicle even still uses it. The graphics are severely outdated and selecting an icon with the touch screen requires you to press and hold for half a second. I mostly use android auto anyway but its still a gripe. MyLink is on its 3rd version now, even the Camaro's system has been updated twice and only been out 3 years. I'm not sure why the Corvette doesn't get an updated infotainment.
The camera's as well are terrible. I think out of every vehicle currently produced by GM, the Corvettes has the worst camera or is tied for worst. My Camaro had a pretty good camera, HD, good line graphics. The Corvette's is just super low resolution. I especially can't see shit when its dark and rainy out. The front curb camera's are a plus but they are also low resolution and trying to determine the actual distance before you hit the curb can be tricky as there are no sensors. Thankfully the car's so short that you honestly don't really need them, just pull into the parking spot and leave yourself like 5 feet of space from the cub and you'll be fine.
Traction control and stability control can both be turned off with the push of a button (or rather a double push), no fumbling through menu's. The Performance Traction Management (PTM) system is wonderful and I have to give GM props for this. You can basically tell the traction control/stability control system what the weather conditions outside are like. Usually when traction control or stability control kick in they do so after you've reached the limit because the car has no idea what the limit is. Using PTM you can tell the car what the limits actually are (wet track, dry track etc). I could go on forever about the system but your better off just googling it, its really amazing though especially on track.
You can set your steering, suspension and exhaust independently from each other (which you couldn't even do in Lamborghini's until this year). Throw the steering into Tour (normal), put the suspension and engine in sport and toss the exhaust into track mode or whatever configuration you like. I love this mostly because I can permanently leave the exhaust in track mode.
Launch control is great, you get zero tire spin. It kind ruins the fun for me though, its to easy. I kind of like spinning the tires a little when I launch it, using launch control just makes it so clinical.
The sound systems alright, nothing great, I'm not an audiophile but even I can tell it isn't amazing. It does what I want it do and that's fine by me.
The infotainment screen can be put down to reveal a small storage area behind it with a USB charger. You could put a phone back there (or your drugs). I use it to store my sunglasses. It's always a neat party trick to show people.
**Interior**
The interior is obviously a huge improvement over the C6. I think aesthetically it looks amazing and has aged very well. I love the angled center console and am a particular fan of getting a non black interior as the dashboard leather also changes. In a base 55k Stingray, the interior feels pretty good, lacking a bit for the price but the performance more then makes up for it.
The dashboard and center console are hard plastic. The dashboard can be replaced with Carbon Fiber, which is a must have option but sadly the center console can't. I'm thinking of going aftermarket to replace it to match my dash. The shifter has an aluminum plate around it for added flair and the window switches are pretty good with some aluminum trim. The rest of the buttons are all hard plastic.
Moving up the Corvette line up makes it a harder sell materials wise. You can opt to add GM's Micro fiber Suede (Alcantara) to the steering wheel, seats and dashboard which helps to mitigate this. I've experienced the suede steering wheel and seats on track and I liked it a lot. I think if I could I'd re order the car with the steering wheel and suede seats for an extra $1k or so that it costs. The full suede interior is a harder sell as you need to get the top trim which is an extra 8k but some people think its worth it to make the interior feel more upscale.
The armrest compartment isn't deep at all, its really only good for storing your phone. It has two USB chargers and I use it when I want android auto. Nothing else will fit in the compartment.
There's a small compartment in the back of the hatch in the floor where you would store your fix a flat, tire pump etc. I use it to store my beer (a six pack will fit perfectly, I've even gotten two growlers in there) when shopping as otherwise I need to bring a box or it will just fly around unsecured in the hatch.
**Ownership**
I did one very important thing after getting the car and that was an alignment. C7 Corvettes are notorious for coming from the factory with awful alignments. In fact I think Motortrend ran into this issue two times with press car's on a Z06. My car was pulling to the right pretty hard in normal driving and would understeer when moderately braking. At first I thought it was the fat tires trying to follow the contour of the road, bumps, cracks etc but it felt way worse then it should. Thankfully GM offers a free alignment after the first 500 miles so naturally I took them up on there gracious offer and it fixed the issues. I'm probably going to get another one done in the spring, it feels a little off again, my city has some pretty bad roads.
The second important thing that should be done to a C7 is adding the upgraded aero, especially the front splitter. I went with the full stage 2 aero from the aftermarket which gave me the splitter, full length side skirts and upgraded spoiler (non-wickerbill). Worth every penny, the car looks mean with it.
I did not option the carbon ceramic brakes. As such I am plagued by the disease that is brake dust. Holy shit is it insane. The stock pads on this car produces so much dust. Wash the wheels, drive the car 10minutes, dust. The solution is to swap to an aftermarket pad, it isn't very costly I just haven't bothered to do it yet.
This car gets looks. 5 years later the C7 still looks great, people stare, people point, non-car enthusiasts think its a front engine Ferrari. People are always yelling to me on the street when I have the roof off or giving me thumbs up. It's a good feeling. I think the car will age very well.
The dealership experience is pretty normal. It may be an expensive Chevy but its still a Chevy. The experience isn't bad by any means but just don't expect to be served a latte in a massaging chair while you wait for your oil change. Some dealers who deal in high volumes of Corvettes may be slightly more upscale or offer a bit more to owners. My local dealer is quite pleasant to deal with. They don't sell many Corvette's but I've never had an issue using them. I had my seat cover replaced under warranty on the driver's side. The headrest grain had completely worn away after 4k kilometers. The red dye of the seat could be rubbed off when wiping it with a cloth. The dealer never questioned it and replaced it under warranty without a hassle. I'll probably get the passenger side done before the warranty ends as I'm sure it follow suit with the driver side. Overall Chevy hasn't tried to screw me over and fight me on anything so its been good so far, no complaints.
Filling up the car is always interesting. The gas pump has a habit of cutting off early. You have to pump slowly or flip the nozzle 180 degrees to fix this otherwise you will never fill up all the way, the pump will just keep shutting off on you because it thinks your full but you still got a 1/4 tank left.
The Corvette community is great, lots of helpful folks. I made an acquaintance on the Corvetteforum when I was shopping for my car. An older gentlemen who lived an hour away. He let me test drive his car and gave me some helpful tips when purchasing. I couldn't believe a stranger would let a young guy like me drive his car. We still keep in touch, mostly about Corvette related topics.
I will say the Corvette community is an extreme though. They live and breathe only Corvette's. A lot of them tend to look down on other performance car's except maybe the Camaro. Talking about Corvette's is fun but after an hour or two I'm ready to get into other car topics. I've tried doing Corvette events but they all ended up like this, fun for an hour afterwards I'm ready to leave because hardly anybody will acknowledge any other car. I'd rather just go to car's and coffee. Not to mention the events are scheduled by retiree's so trying to attend when you work 9-5 ain't easy.
**Summary**
It's been a great 6 months with this car, I love this thing. I don't regret getting it. My few gripes are tolerable, my general experiences have been great and any issues I've had with the car have been handled correctly. Now I can only hope I can survive the next 5 months without driving it.

"Ten days and 2,100 miles with my 2018 Charger Scat pack.
https://imgur.com/gallery/MKTnaOt
I ordered my car on February 20th and took delivery April 13th. So far I am in love with the car and wanted to write a quick review of how my week and a half has been. For anyone wondering the sticker price on mine was $44,700 and I got it for $36,827 before taxes and fees. This price included a $1,000 USAA rebate. My dealer charged a $299 doc fee. People always seem to be interested in that.
The two vehicles I had previously to the Charger were a 2008 Infiniti G35, and a 2014 Mustang GT 6 speed. Overall I like the Charger a lot more, but it has some flaws that those two didn't.
Interior wise this car is interesting. The quality is honestly pretty good for what it is. Of course it's a brand new car but everything feels solid. The dashboard material looks a little cheap and just rubbing your fingers on it will leave oil marks but it's better than my previous cars so I'm happy. The heated/vented seats and the heated steering wheel are awesome. The Beats stereo is pretty good. It's certainly no Burmeister system but it's better than the Bose system I had in my Infiniti. Seat comfort is okay at best. They are pretty hard and the bolsters jam up into my thighs. Even though they are hard I felt no fatigue or soreness after an eleven hour day in the car. That surprised me. This car suffers from the same problem as my G35 did. The interior space is pathetic for how large this car is. There is almost twice the amount of rear leg room in my wife's Sonata compared to this car. Front seat space is good. The car is wide. Trunk space is okay but with the subwoofer in there I feel like my Mustang had a more usable trunk.
Uconnect is great. The interface feels like a reskinned Ipad. Much more responsive than most infotainment systems I've used. The car has performance pages \(0\-60, 0\-100, 1/8th, 1/4th, G meter, top speed readout and launch control which I haven't used yet. The seven inch display between the gauges is neat. The engine temp/fuel gauge is digital and you can reconfigure the readouts to your liking. For example you can have the digital speedometer in the upper portion or in the middle with larger font. There is also engine hp/tq readouts.
Handling is a mixed bag for me. This car does not handle like a pickup truck or Grand Marquis but it's no 6th gen Camaro either. There's a clover leaf on ramp on my way to work that I used to love taking in the G35. I could go 40\-45 mph and the car would be at the absolute limit of traction in kind of a slide. It was great fun and easy to control. My Mustang could take it about the same speed but was more frightening because of the live axle. The Charger feels like it's very close to it's limit at 35 mph. Going through tight turns the Charger can do it. But it's not very fun. It's a chore to drive fast through corners. Where as my Infiniti was down right fun in comparison. However weight and a long wheelbase have their advantages. Drifting this car is a piece of cake. In my G35 when I would slide the rear out it felt twitchy and would sometimes come around more than I meant it to. The Mustang was downright scary to slide because of axle hop. The Charger will effortlessly kick it's rear out and do exactly what you want it to. Also when you break traction while moving the rear stays planted. This car is very predictable and does what you want it to as long as you respect the gas pedal. Cruising at 100\+ mph feels as solid as 60 mph. Mine has the 245mm Goodyears. They're obviously way too skinny for this much power. But they have a good amount of grip. Much better than the Pirelli P zeros that came on my Mustang and the Yokohamas on my G35. Not as good the the Michelin PSSs I put on the Mustang.
Braking is great. I have the four piston Brembos on mine and they have no problem stopping 4,400 pounds from 150 mph. On the Mustang/G35 slowing from even 120 mph would cause the brakes to shake a little. It's a huge difference. I will never buy a performance car without high performance brakes again. I never knew what I was missing.
The ZF8 is fantastic. That said, it's not as fun as a manual. The auto does a great job of mimicking a manual though. If you're at a light you can take your foot off the brake and the car will sit still. It downshifts to engine brake on it's own. If you're cruising and stab the gas then let off really quick it will jump to a lower gear and stay there for quite some time. Shifts are very fast and the gearing is fantastic. There is no speed that this car is caught in a dead rpm zone. All of that is amplified if you active sport mode. Shifting firms up a lot and it holds gears. One thing I really like about this transmission is it allows you to have some fun in normal auto mode without sport mode engaged. Rolling onto the gas slowly from a stop it will shift at 3k rpms and you get to hear the exhaust. You don't have to stomp the pedal to the floor for it to downshift or get above 2k rpms. The zinc paddles feel high quality and the response is awesome. I use them almost every day. Where as with my G35 I used the manual mode maybe five times.
The exhaust note is glorious. I had GT500 axle backs and resonator deletes on my 2014 5.0 and this stock exhaust is louder and sounds better. I will say I think the 2018 Mustang GT with the active exhaust sounds slightly better. Startup is a nice bark and then a low rumble. This car has active exhaust but it's always loud. Around 3k rpms the note changes from a deep rumble, almost similar to a V8 truck with Borlas, into a screeching wail. Flooring it under an over pass or next to a concrete barrier gives me goose bumps. Engine noise is a nice V8 burble. It sounds different than a Coyote or LS. You can tell this is a large displacement engine by the noise. My Coyote sounded exotic in comparison if that makes sense. The tone is very American. There is some drone. More so than my Mustang had even with it's modified exhaust. It's not an issue if you have the radio on though.
Dodge might come up short in some areas but they created something special with this 392 Hemi. This car feels big. You can tell it is a massive, heavy boat. All of that weight completely disappears the second you roll onto the gas. When I had my Mustang and would roll on in too high of a gear you could tell. Even after the 93 tune I got. The car wouldn't be accelerating as fast as you wanted. Around 3,500 \- 4,000 rpms it really woke up. Not so with the 6.4L. Any gear, any rpm it just goes. It has no problem accelerating quite quickly from 1,200 rpms in 8th. It will break the tires loose from 1,700 rpms in 5th. Floor it at 80 mph and it slams you into the seat and just keeps pulling. It was still pulling hard at 150 mph when I let off. I love this engine.  
This car has Sport mode and I felt it deserved it's own paragraph. You can customize Sport mode to your liking. For example you could set it so traction control and steering feel are normal, but engine/trans response are more abrupt. I have all of it set to the highest setting. Sport mode turns it into a different car. It feels way faster, the shifts are harsh and quicker. The exhaust seems louder at low rpms. Gears are held longer and 4 cylinder mode is disabled. It's just different from other cars I've experienced with a Sport mode. Instead of just holding gears longer it actually transforms the driving experience. 
I took it on a road trip with the cruise set anywhere from 78\-90 mph \(Texas, New Mexico, Utah\) and got 25 mpg. Commuting I've been getting 19 mpg with a lot of spirited driving. I got the exact same mpg out of my 93 tuned 3.31 rear axle Mustang 5.0.
Overall I really love this car. I have no delusions about it being some world beater like an E63 S. I know there are a lot of cars that are faster/nicer/better but for just under 40k out the door I am more than pleased.",2
"When is it better to buy a 'new' car instead of fixing the old one?
So currently I'm using my parents' spare car, a 2002 hyundai elantra. It's perfect for me right now as I'm still learning to drive but I suspect the time will come that something major's going to break. About a year ago we had to get a new radiator, about 6 months ago had to replace the clutch. Now the AC doesn't work (belt ripped, tensionner pulley fell off the car (?) and is now lost somewhere on a road) and the wipers got stuck on the down position because of rust. I tried fixing the wiper mecanism but managed to rip the passenger side gear thing meaning only the driver's side works. There was a fuel leak about 3 months ago which we fixed but the fuel lines are rusted so I don't know how long the rest of it will last. The car also has a lot of rust and hasn't really been taken care of besides of regular oil changes. Brakes have to be done soon as well.
I'm now at this point where I'm asking myself if it's better to buy another (more reliable) car instead of keeping this money pit of a car. It would be from about the same year because of my budget but hopefully there's something more reliable out there. I think for now I'll try to get the wiper mechanism from a junkyard since it's pretty cheap but soon enough there will be another part that's going to break.",2
"Quick question, don't upvote.
I just got my [grandpa's 71 impala](http://imgur.com/4DkxQHC). It's very rusty and has been sitting for 2 years or so. It's basically my first project car. I know the basics of engines, less about old v8's and more about 4 cylinder imports, so this is a bit new to me. From what gramps says the engine is fine just needs some TLC, the rubber is falling apart on it; needs replacing. He also says the tranny has a small leak, doesn't know where its coming from at the moment. No idea what the mileage is, but the 350 small block engine is not the original. 
As of now, I'm trying to get it started and take it home. It wasn't getting any fuel, my grandpa said it's the fuel pump. I have one on the way that I will install myself. My dad said he will help me with funds when I work on the car.
So now with a little background, the question I wanted to ask.**How viable would this be for a daily driver? What kind of work would I need to put into it?** I'm currently a full-time college student and only need to commute about 130 miles a week. To school and to the gym. I have a very small fund of 500 dollars, but like I said my dad is willing to put a lot of money into it too (probably way more than my 500). I do have a backup car incase this was to break down, my current daily, an 88 civic. I don't plan on getting rid of the civic. I can always get my grandpa to help me troubleshoot, and I have access to most of the tools I will need.",2
"Finally did my first Autocross
I got a B7 RS4 last week, and decided after years of owning fast cars but rarely tracking them I needed to actually justify having it.
We had a double header out at the Blue Crab Stadium in Waldorf, MD (8 runs total).
The even was put on by Autcross Inc. and even though I rolled in a bit late (went to the wrong stadium.... Not a great start right? At least I never got lost on the course!) they let me walk (well I kind of had to run) the course and get in the first heat.
I started the day 60+ and had it in my head to break 50 by the end of the day. It might not be great racing by most standards, [but I was proud as hell when I finished this run.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IYNWqR7cqo)
That car has a lot more to it, and I've got to grow as a driver to take advantage of it.
Big props to the guys at Autocross Inc. Everyone there was very open and made it such an easy place to learn and make mistakes.
Is this an accomplishment that will go down in the history books? Not in the least, but after making changes and learning the car all day getting that 49.6 felt like winning the freaking Olympics.

"AAA towing, how soon can you really use it? Experiences?
Hey folks,
Against better judgement (isn't that how it always works?) I'm going to be making a 400 mile trip to a car show about a week after I get my GTI back on the road. Yes it's a stupid idea, but I set the goal of finishing the car to drive it to this show, so I want to carry through with it. It will have gotten all new brake hard lines, new brakes and MC, new struts, coilover sleeves, etc. a new fuel tank, fuel pump, and a timing belt. In short, lots of stuff could leak, some stuff could break. I'm going to try and do a bunch of short shake down trips within the 50 mile radius of my Hagerty Ins. policy towing range this weekend to make sure everything is good to go, but I'm still nervous.
So that brings me to AAA. A couple years ago I signed up hoping I could get my POS daily driver at the time which was having frequent problems towed to a mechanic. I was told there was a wait before I could. I sucked it up and paid for the tow.
Now I'm thinking that it's worth it again to sign up for the Premier Membership that would cover a single 200 mile tow and 3 x 100 mi. tows. 200 miles would be the half way point to get me home or to the show destination.
I'm leaving for the show on the 15th of April, so I have 10 days before I go. In reading the AAA member benefits I see the fine print:
** AAA Plus and AAA Premier Members are eligible to receive AAA Plus and AAA Premier benefits seven (7) days after receipt of payment. AAA Premier members receive all AAA Classic and all AAA Plus benefits as enhanced by the AAA Premier benefits. The chart shows just some of the AAA Classic, AAA Plus and AAA Premier benefits.***
This was taken from AAA Membership Benefits on their website.
So technically I would be safe if I paid up today.
Has anyone tested the rules of this by signing up and cutting it as close as I am?
Did you have any resistance from AAA?
Are they true to their word or could they shaft me on it somehow if it's that soon after the 7 day wait?
I don't want to spend $123 and be told tough shit if I do need it.
In reading about AAA online it seems like sometimes they are sticklers for the rules, and sometimes you could break down on the side of the road and sign up for a membership on the spot and get a tow.  I have a hard time believing the later is always the case.",2
"Let's have a first car story thread
Good or bad, what was your first car and your favorite stories about it. Here's mine !
I got my first two flats at the same time with my first car in high school. It was a 88 Nissan Sentra(I'm six foot two) that I paid $400 and i would smack a bitch Wayne Brady style to get it back. I turned into a McDonalds and hit a pot hole on the passenger side that blew both tires. $25 a piece to have them replaced. 
Other memorable moments with that car include the week I locked myself out of my car at school 4 out 5 days. 
When I went around a blind corner(no power steering)on a road id bever been down i was surprised to find out how well the car could jump a curb and not break anything.
 I went to football game between the two bigger schools and while backing out out a parking apce I learned about angle when I clipped the chrome bumper on an explorer and proceeded to but a 8 foot long dent in the car. The explorers bumper didnt even have a scratch. 
My favorite memory of that car came when I tried to get on the interstate for the first time ever and nearly shit myself for 5 miles to the next exit because that thing couldn't do 70 let alone a straightish line(again, no power steering in a $400 car). 
Other perks included ice cold air conditioning that snow sometimes came out of the vents. I could reach every window roller and lock from the driver seat and operate them while driving.",2
"C7 Grand Sport Owner's Review of a 2016 Tesla Model X
So I got married this weekend and my friend decided to rent a 90D Tesla Model X for the wedding to help chauffeur family members around. I ended up driving the car for about (3) days and here are my impressions on the following: Power, Handling, Practicality, Style, Build Quality, and Overall Driving Experience. 
**Power (Powah!)** 
I drove a Model X 90D a few years ago at a Tesla dealership when looking for a new car for my dad. I was impressed with the power then, but the dealership driving experience was only about 15 minutes and was very much about showing all of the car's features so it was hard to really get a grasp for the car's power. 
In driving it around the past few days I got a much better sense of the car's power delivery and it is pretty enjoyable. 
The electric motors and AWD system give the car a near instantaneous and perfectly tractioned power delivery at all times. You put the pedal down and you begin to feel the car surge forward in proportion to how much throttle you are giving it. 
We've all heard the stories of Teslas slaying other cars in drag races and torching nearly everyone from 0-60. The 90D has a 0-60 time slated at around 4.8 seconds, which is fast but nowhere near legendary, but to be honest the car felt much stronger than that. 
A big reason for this is because the Model X doesn't have to change gears and can respond to throttle input very rapidly. Sure other cars can do 0-60 in say 4 seconds, but they have to be in the right gear, with the right surface, and with enough traction to make that pull possible. Too much throttle input and the car breaks traction, too little and you missed your shot at the perfect 4 seconds. 
With the Model X when you put your foot down the car immediately goes ""alright this is the maximum amount of power I can give you without breaking traction"" and I've never seen a car react so quickly to driver input. 
Now I will say, after the initial 3-4 seconds of acceleration the Model X does feel like it runs out of torque/steam a little bit. One of the things I like about my C7 is that it can pull from 0 and still pull well into 120+mph. The Model X feels like it stops pulling just after 70mph. 
On the flip side, when I got back into my C7 I was actually a little frustrated with its power delivery. I would give the car a 50% throttle input, which in the Model X would pretty much shoot me flying down the road, and the C7 would first start trying to find the right gear and would then have the torque come on, and the whole ordeal just felt like it took too long. Bear in mind the C7 is objectively the faster car, and I typically describe its 6.2L V8 as ""Power everywhere"" compared to the majority of turbocharged cars on the market today. So the Model X's power delivery really is quite impressive if it is making a C7 Grand Sport feel a little dull. 
One other thing that I hear mentioned quite often is how EV's lack character or ""soul"" without an engine and I actually didn't find that to be the case in the Model X. The ""Whine"" of the electric motors felt plenty satisfying and honestly seemed more organic than the exhausts you might hear in a luxury vehicle. With luxury vehicles you kind of hear the exhaust sometimes so that your car feels kind of cool and sporty, but then they try to mask it so that you get that feeling of ""luxury"" by being disconnected from the world around you. This car manages to be objectively quieter than any other luxury car on the market, while also sounding way cooler. Again, I'm used to listening to a very nice sounding 6.2L V8 and I found the motor ""whine"" to be just as fun to listen to as a V8 exhaust. 
**Handling** 
I'm honestly not a fan of poor handling cars. It's why I don't like cars that are too much bigger than a mid-size sedan and when I see something that weighs over 3500lbs I start talking to myself about how porky the vehicle must be to drive. I especially dislike the whole SUV/Crossover thing that is happening right now as I feel like those vehicles add weight and ride height for little returns in other areas. 
That being said, the handling is a genuine high point with the Model X. 
The best part of the car's handling to me comes from the fact that it uses pretty aggressive regenerative braking. When you take your foot off the accelerator the car begins to immediately ""engine brake"" as the motors recoup energy from the rolling resistance of the wheels. 
The regenerative braking makes for a driving experience that is oddly telepathic. Feel like you're going too fast? Left off the accelerator and within a few seconds you're 15 mph slower *without* touching the brakes. Feel like you're coming into a turn too hot? Let off the the throttle for a second and the reduction in speed has allowed the car to recompose itself...*without* you having to slam on the brakes. 
I found the regenerative braking to really hide the weight of the car well. Heavy cars have a lot of momentum, which can make for a painful driving experience. They take a long time to get up to speed, and once they are up to speed you have to use the brakes for an agonizingly long time to get them to slow down. The regenerative braking allows the Model X to start slowing down almost instantly. 
Coasting into stop lights was almost Zen-like in this car. Let off the throttle about 150' out and just tap the brakes for a second at the very end to help it come to a complete stop. You can legitimately do 95% of your driving with one pedal in this car.
Beyond the regenerative braking the Model X 90D has air suspension which allows you to set different ride heights. At the ""high"" setting the car feels much more ""floaty"" like a traditional SUV on the ""low"" setting the car has a lower center of gravity and handles more like a traditional car would. I kept the car in the ""low"" setting.
I had my car's steering set to ""sport"", it wasn't overly communicative but it was weighted quite well and all inputs did feel very direct with this vehicle. 
Between the traction control and AWD system I found that this car took corners surprisingly well. I would often throw the car into a corner at 50mph (thanks mainly to its great power delivery) only to realize that the car really needed to be at 35mph for the corner to be handled properly and I could sense some pre-emptive braking happening in the proper wheels of the car to get it to negotiate the turn well. It wasn't too intrusive, and was exactly what the car needed to handle the turn properly. 
Being an EV vehicle, the Model X allows you to disable creep, which is the slow amount of rolling your car does at idle. I found this to be a great addition to my driving experience. When confronted with pedestrian traffic or at a stop light I could take my foot off the brake and my car would just relax until the coast was clear to proceed. The lack of creep made me feel like a much safer driver because I didn't feel like I had the car trying to urge me on too much in low speed situations. 
I did feel like the brakes on the car weren't particularly powerful (this could partially be from it being a rental vehicle), but on the plus side the regen is so good you kind of don't need the brakes all that often. 
I also found that I couldn't quite turn the wheel over quick enough when navigating in parking lots. The turning radius was often always there, but the steering ratio made it hard for me to get the wheels in the right angle to get to a certain spot or to make a particularly tight turn. Not the end of the world per say...something I would likely adjust to if driving full time but a small inconvenience. 
All in all this was the most enjoyable large vehicle I have driven from a handling perspective. Is it going to load-up G's like a C7 Grand Sport? No...but it's going to feel incredibly swift and agile for its size and will more than handle most people's needs. From someone who daily drives a bona fide sports car the handling is very enjoyable. 
**Practicality**
Surprisingly, from a purely spatial perspective the Model X is not as practical as you would think. Without the back row of seats folded down there's virtually no trunk space and the cabin isn't too wide, tall, or long so you do feel like it gets full fast. The middle row of ""captain"" seats in my vehicle also didn't fold down which made fitting long items in a little troublesome. 
Now the Model X does have some cool features like automatic doors, Falcon wing doors! Autopilot, a great touch screen UI, so how did that all pan out? 
The automatic doors are kind of cool at first but they quickly become awkward and annoying. There are no handles on the doors (instead you press a toggle-like, silver button to open) so the only way to really open them is with the motors. The toggles are annoying and inconvenient to use, and when using the key fob you do feel like you need to touch the key fob more than you would like for them to open. 
The doors do have sensors on them, which is great for preventing them from hitting the car next to you, but if you are standing in front of the door (which you often will be) it will not open all of the way for fear of hitting you. Then when you go to pull the door open wider it sort of resists you at first making for an awkward opening experience. The trunk behaves in very much the same way. 
Closing the automatic doors is generally a breeze, you can use the touchscreen to do so or just press on the keyfob once and all the doors close. But the process of opening everything to begin with really is tedious and awkward. 
The falcon wing doors are pretty cool when they work, but they very often get confused and don't open all of the way. The whole point of the falcon wing doors is so tall people can comfortably enter the second row of the vehicle, and we had the doors fail to deploy at full height about 40% of the time, which made for very difficult entrances for the people in the back. Given the consistency of the falcon wing doors, regular doors would have been better. 
Autopilot worked fairly well, but it did seem less impressive than when I first saw it. I think that's partially because other manufacturers are starting to include similar functionality, and partially because of all of the negative press surrounding autopilot. I honestly didn't use auto-pilot too often because I did enjoy driving the car, and part of me didn't trust it in certain areas. Where I would 100% use it is in stop and go traffic or in highway conditions that are just frustrating to be a part of. 
I turned on auto-pilot in one situation where I was between a semi-truck in one lane, an awkwardly driving car in front of me, and some pretty aggressive cars passing on the left. Such a situation would genuinely piss me off when driving, but with auto pilot it did start to feel ""okay"" for some reason. I saw someone describe this in another thread, but with auto-pilot on you feel like both you and the car are driving so when people are doing frustrating things it feels like they are doing it to the car and not to you, and that makes things better. 
The touch screen and UI is pretty phenomenal. Definitely best that I have seen available in terms of responsiveness, and general design. The dash is also all digital and feels like an Audi virtual cockpit but even better...despite the fact that it was released *before* Audi virtual cockpit. All vital information is pretty easy to find, you can control just about anything using the touch screen (from doors opening to moving your middle row seats forward or backwards) it feels like a very novel way to control a vehicle, but it's the way vehicles *should* be controlled. 
That being said, there were a few things that I had issue with. The touch screen *is* distracting and I found myself taking my eyes off the road too much to navigate it, read it, and to digest what it was doing. 
I found the phone integration to be lacking. It does not read back SMS messages, bluetooth connectivity was a little inconsistent, and in general it just did not feel as full featured as my C7's integration. 
The navigation on the Model X is the only ""in-car"" navigation that I would dare to use over Google Maps on my phone. The ""in-car"" navigation is pretty much powered by Google and is very similar to Google maps, it is just optimized for the Car's UI a bit more (e.g. you can easily locate superchargers, etc). Every other car feels like it has a nav system from 2008, so kudos to Tesla for not peddling a BS navigation system built into the car. 
While the Tesla touchscreen UI is very good and way better than what any other manufacturer offers...I found Android Auto to be a bit more intuitive, safer, and just better to use. So at some point I think Tesla either needs to really up their UI game to stay competitive or make way for proper Android Auto and Apple Car Play integration to stay competitive. 
For whatever reason the Model X lacks a blind spot alert system. The car isn't too bad to see out of, but there are a lot pillars that feel like they are blocking your view so lane changes for me weren't as confidence inspiring as I would have liked. This seems like an odd omission given the array of sensors that the car has to use for autopilot. 
The Model X does have a frunk which is sized pretty generously. I was able to fit about (3) well sized backpacks in it. The only thing about the frunk is that it *does* have to latch close (very similarly to how you would close an engine hood) which requires a decent amount of effort to engage the latch. I feel like this is more of a government regulation thing than a Tesla thing, but it was annoying having to slam the frunk close so hard. I'd be okay with it if it was an engine bay, but not so much as a cargo area. 
I think some small tweaks on a few choice dimensions and adding some more flexibility with the seat configurations would make for a vastly more practical vehicle, but honestly, if you do not have the need to seat more than (5) passengers a Tesla Model S would likely be the most practical vehicle in the Tesla lineup. The Model X *looks* more practical than it is. 
*Styling*
When the Model X first came out I thought it was a great looking car. In looking at it today, it does feel a bit stale/dated. I think part of this has to do with the fact that Teslas are pretty ubiquitous in Southern California so everyone is used to seeing them, and part of it is because the general Tesla design language is pretty subtle and minimalist.
That being said this car came out in 2015 and *does* need a body refresh. My C7 came out in 2014 and I feel like I could look at it for another (4) years before feeling like it was starting to lose some of its design appeal. 
One thing that I will say about the Model X is that I never walked up to it going ""I can't believe I get to drive this"" and in looking at the rest of the Tesla lineup I can't say I would say the same thing about any of their other cars...including the roadster. So as a brand they do need to figure out how to get some of that raw ""I want this"" emotion into their cars from a visual perspective. 
A cool item to note is that the car does have a spoiler that provides active aero. When you brake the spoiler starts pointing down to ""air brake"" and when you accelerate it re-levels itself out. Fun to look at and always good to have. 
The air suspension is also a pretty cool feature to have in general and I wished more cars employed it. 
I think the design of the interior is generally quite nice. It has minimalist-modern design cues and feels very ""Apple-store"" and ""California"" to me. Everything looks pretty clean and simple, it's not ""holy crap I want this interior"" like one would find in a modern Audi but it's an interior that fits the general Tesla ""clean, modern, future"" ethos quite well. 
The seats look very nice and are pretty comfortable to sit in. They have a gloss black hard plastic on their back-side which looks pretty cool, but it does show imperfections quite easily...which isn't good for a car that will have a lot of people+luggage going in and out of it. 
From a design perspective I think the interior looks great. It is let down by the overall quality of materials though. Everything feels kind of light, hollow, and plasticy. Tesla lines the pillars with a carpet that feels like Alcantara, which I'm sure someone said ""oh man Alcantara is a high quality material let's use that"" but it makes the pillars look a little cheap and gaudy somehow. 
In the flip side, my rental vehicle which had about 40K miles on it didn't seem to show too much wear. So though the materials don't feel that great...they seem to hold up well, but when you do get into the car you do notice that the interior is a little cheap. 
One note that I had is that I probably saw about (30) other Model X's that looked *exactly* the same as the car that I was driving. To be honest, given the design language of the Model X there's not tons that you can do to the car to make it unique or to spice it up in the way of visual mods, etc.  So when driving the Model X it really does not feel like you are turning any heads at all and you are seeing carbon copies of yourself pretty frequently. It makes for a rather sterile/unremarkable feeling. I've driven popular cars before but never have I encountered so many carbon copies in such a short span of time. 
Overall the Model X is a very clean looking car and if you like modern/minimalist design there's a lot to appreciate but its styling cues aren't blowing anyone away or making you particularly excited to look at it or be in it.
**Build Quality**
Ah build quality the oft-cited Achilles heel of Tesla. To be honest I very much have jumped on the Tesla hate train because I think cars with poor build quality just aren't acceptable in today's age, and *especially* at the pricepoint that Tesla's are commanding. So how did my model fair? 
In general the build quality of my Model X felt a little lacking. When we got in our car the overall fit and finish of it made it feel like the car was 6-7 years old nearing 90-100K miles not a three year old car with 40K miles on it. 
It is hard to really describe what made the car feel this way, but it was generally subtle items like seeing the window valets allow a sizable gap between the window and the weather stripping in the way they were angled, a loose trim piece here and there, a random area that would be hidden or finished in other cars that for some reason was exposed and didn't look to be particularly squared away. 
There were a few notable build quality things that I noticed. 
The Falcon Wing doors and the front door on my drivers side didn't quite line up nor did the falcon wing door sit as flush with the rest of the car body. 
The middle row seats didn't feel completely secure/locked to the floor. So when you accelerated the car the  base of the seats would slightly rock back. 
There were odd rattles coming from the sun shades...which seemed like a stupid place for rattles come from. 
When turning the wheel a great deal (say to angle your self into a parking spot) the steering rack would make this weird creaking noise. I kind of chalk this one up to being more of a rental car owner not maintaining their vehicle well...but at the same time no other rental car that I have driven (some of which were pretty poorly maintained) did that. 
My car had a white pearl multi-coat paint option. To be honest this white just didn't feel very premium to me nor was I particularly wowed by the quality of the paint, but at the same time I didn't notice any swirls or immediate imperfections in the paint job either. 
One item that really bugged me is that the range was a lot less than advertised when driving this car. I had one day where all I did was ferry items from one apartment to the other. The apartments were about (3) miles away from each other and I made about (4) round trips total. So let's peg the total distance traveled at around 40 miles to be generous. I started the day with 160 miles left on the charge and ended with close to 90. 
Now granted I was driving a bit spiritedly, but in my C7 a series of trips like that would barely move the gas needle and in the Tesla it felt like I had used a very significant amount of charge. 
A weird positive about all of the weird build quality issues that I noticed on this Tesla is that you can drive it without fear of ruining its ""perfection"". I'm not a particularly anal person, but with my C7 every little scratch or imperfection feels like a stab in the heart. With this I feel like some knick, scratch, or ding could happen and it wouldn't eat away at you too much because the rest of the car is already a little imperfect. 
Though this car did have build quality issues it wasn't necessarily the end of the world. It was still totally a livable car, the weird inconsistencies didn't eat away at me, and yes it wasn't German ""solid"" but this particular car felt more right than wrong. 
**Overall Driving Experience** 
I have a lot of different thoughts in this section because there are a few different stories to tell. 
When we grabbed the car our Turo driver only left (100) miles of range in it. Knowing where we were going for the day this felt like plenty of mileage, but as I noted the Tesla burns through its battery faster than you would think. So a day's worth of activities that could easily be accomplished with 100 miles of range on gas became an anxiety inducing experience as we found ourselves only having (30) miles of range more quickly than we should have. 
I live in Orange County California and though superchargers aren't super ubiquitous here there are EV charging spots at a lot of local shopping areas. Only problem is, Teslas use a different charger connector than the universal standard that everyone uses and so an adapter is needed...which of course our Turo host did not provide. 
So we had to find ourselves a Supercharger. The problem that we ran into was that they were not spaced very well in Orange County, and we noticed that they were primarily in areas that had cheap real estate and not really centralized in the richer areas where more Tesla owners would likely live. 
Upon arriving at our supercharger of choice we encountered what was an oddly ravenous collection of Teslas occupying nearly all (20) stalls. We got the impression that a lot of the people using these had a ""hoard"" mentality where they were using a supercharger not because they had to, but because they just didn't want to spend the money on their own electricity. 
I guess this comes with the territory of a car that is advertised as being economical, you get a lot of cheapskates, but it's a mentality that really pisses me off and is a far cry from the general Corvette owner's mentality of ""Who cares what happens we can beat up on Porsche's and Ferrari's 'Murica!""
If I drove a Tesla I can see myself hating other people who drive Teslas. A lot of them acted like morons at the Superchargers I was at and it would be a far cry from the experience of owning my Corvette where everyone is waving to each other and generally having a good time. 
You also see how Tesla conveniently twists the truth for themselves. 10,000+ superchargers but none in an area that you actually want to be at. 
So there was this weird experience dealing with people who felt oddly greedy and seemed like they drove their cars not because they liked them, but because they felt like it saved them money. There was also this experience of a company definitely telling some half truths and being a bit misleading in how practical and convenient their charging network really was. 
Tesla very much has the promise of the future tied to their ethos. They go above and beyond to try to automate everything, integrate everything, and to be on the cutting edge of what can be offered with a vehicle and I have a mixed takeaway. 
Tesla falls pretty flat with this vehicle's automatic door integration. It's futuristic yes, but feels very clumsy and awkward due to how easily the sensors can get tricked. Likewise, though Tesla does a very good job with the infotainment system it does fall short of what is offered by Apple Carplay and Android Auto...but to Tesla's credit they have the only system that can remotely compete with Apple Carplay and Android Auto. Literally every other car infotainment system is a waste of time in terms of integration and sophistication. Tesla's has some good effort behind it, but it's showing age behind the constantly evolving Carplay and Android Auto.
Where Tesla does get things right is that every feature on this car feels ""complete"" and well integrated into the car's ecosystem. I feel like a lot of vehicles go ""We have this cool feature but mainly because it looks good on paper...we didn't put too much time into it though so don't ask too many questions"" whereas the Model X has features because that's what Tesla thinks is necessary for a great driving experience. A prime example of this is Audi's virtual cockpit. Audi put virtual cockpit into their cars because they thought it was cool selling point...not because it worked particularly well and not because the cars necessarily needed it. The Model X has a dash display that is well integrated, looks and works better than virtual cockpit, and it's not even a major selling point of the Model X...it's just a part of the vehicle. 
In a sense, nothing on a Model X feels gimmicky. Yes some of it isn't executed as perfectly as one would hope or expect, but you get the impression that Tesla really tried to make a complete product with the features that they offer. With every other car it's just a base vehicle with stupid loosely integrated stuff that the manufacturer throws on top to drive the price up. 
A Tesla product feels very much like an Apple product in this regard. Yes, an Apple product may be lacking some odd features that the competition has but the Apple product has a vision behind it and that's something that you can buy into. With the Model X, you can tell there was a vision for the vehicle. With every other vehicle I have driven the vision stops at ""get the customer to buy this"" but there's something more behind the Model X that's driving it and I think that's why Tesla has such a rabid fanbase. 
What I like the most about the Model X is that it really does feel like this is how driving *should* be. The cabin is quiet, the car is more responsive than anything you can find in an ICE engine, and after a while you really do begin to feel like the car is just an extension of yourself. Everything in the Model X is just pleasant to do. You can hop in and go easily, you can enjoy some genuine performance, and I'm no hippy but it does feel nice driving around and knowing that you aren't burning fossil fuels. This car tries to be safe, practical, fun, and convenient all at once and it does a great job at all of these things solely because it is an EV vehicle. If they gave this car an ICE and left everything else the same, it would be only a fraction as enjoyable as it currently is. 
As a performance oriented car-guy I really had a great experience with this vehicle and felt like it had a lot to offer in terms of driver engagement. It's just so immediate and responsive to every input that you give it and when you get into an ICE car again it really feels like a dinosaur or old relic by comparison. The Model X is no performance vehicle so don't buy it for that reason, but if you're used to driving a performance a vehicle you won't have a huge hole in your heart when driving a Model X. It will keep you plenty satisfied for a vehicle of its size. 
I'm not a Tesla fanboy by any means, but this experience is really making me consider trying a Model S or a Model 3 as a replacement for my Grand Sport. The Model X is not a perfect vehicle by any means and I would definitely not recommend going out on a limb or going poor to try to afford this car. It is *not* worth the 90-100K that they ask for it. 
But to me, EV's are definitely the future and I would rather be using an crappy refrigerator than still be buying ice from the world's best iceman. I'm baffled as to how not all other car manufacturers dropped their current lineups for proper EV vehicles back in 2012 when the Model S was released, because the EV experience is so obviously superior to anything that an ICE can provide. 
**TL:DR** Flawed vehicle that is definitely not worth the price point, but the EV driving experience is phenomenal and definitely the way of the future. ",2
"2014 Subaru WRX - Dealer installed short block overheated after less than 10 miles. PLEASE ADVISE!
About a month ago, my 2014 WRX developed engine knock. SHOCKER! After having it towed my local Subaru service department, their techs determined that the knock was a result of rod/bearing failure. Having kept the mileage fairly low \(45K\) I was still covered by the factory powertrain warranty \(5yr/60K\), and Subaru agreed to replace the short block and any other engine components that were either damaged or contaminated. I of course gave them the green light to begin repairs!
Fast forward a week, I receive confirmation that the new block has been installed and after a successful test drive by their tech, the car was ready to be picked up. So I head over to the dealership, chat briefly with the service department manager and advisor about break\-in procedure and 1,000 mile check\-up/oil change, then grab the keys and head on my way. I turn on the car and am greeted with the familiar boxer rumble and a smooth steady idle, and once the engine has had ample time to to warm up, I drive off.
Unfortunately, things quickly went south. After merging onto a nearby interstate, I notice the check engine light has turned on and then watch as the temperature gauge shoots up into the red. White smoke begins to billow out of my front end, and I immediately pull of to the side of the road and shut down the engine. Mind you, this was less than 10 miles from the dealership. I call the service department to alert them of my issue, and set up a tow from Subaru roadside assistance. Once the engine finally stopped smoking, I pop the hood and can see what appears to be coolant splattered everywhere with a small pool gathering in the splash guard.
2 1/2 hours later, I finally return to the service department in the passenger seat of a tow truck. The manager offers me a loaner car, and assures me I will receive a call when they determine the problem. I agree and again head on my way. As promised, the service department advisor calls me later that day and reports that a coolant hose clamp had failed, causing the engine to overheat and spray coolant. They reattached the hose and tightened the clamp, degreased the engine, added coolant, and after a taking test drive determined that everything was in working order, and again I could come pick up the car.
Now, here is why I write to you....Should I be concerned that irreparable damage was done to the new short block as a result of the overheating? Is it likely or possible that this would have negatively affected the longevity of the engine and may lead to premature failure? The service department advisor reminded me that they provide a 1 year warranty on all of their repairs, however, I worry that the integrity of the engine has been compromised. Should I accept their explanation? Should I demand further testing? Should I ask for another new short block? Am I overreacting? What should I do? Note, i've yet to return to pick up my car.",2
"My Honda Civic hit 250,000 miles.
I have 2009 Honda Civic hybrid that hit 250k miles today. It's never had any issues, and has been to dealer only for oil change. Should I be worried it's going break down soon? It still sounds normal and drives normal. ",2
"What car are you glad you got rid of?
I want to hear about the lemon you pawned off or the junker you don't miss at all.
For me, it's probably my 86 Cressida. I traded a Saab 900T for it, and then manual swapped it. The whole time I owned it, I was terrified to drive it anywhere because I just kept getting the feeling it was gonna break down or blow up. After I got the manual swap done, I still got the feeling it was gonna wet the bed every time I drove it, so I sold it back to the guy I got it from for double what I paid for it, and I've never missed it. About a week after he picked it up, a freeze plug blew out of it, then the CV axles broke, so I'm confident I made the right choice. ",2
"I ordered some Ford ignition coils from eBay. They are labeled as ""For use in vehicles circulating in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean."" What's the difference?
I really need to stop buying parts off eBay.
These are AC Delco parts.  Yes, I know AC Delco is a GM OEM, but they also make/sell parts for other makes as well.  I felt better buying something that's probably higher quality than the extremely questionable Chinese junk that's out there (like the Motor King set I bought three years ago that I'm now slowly replacing as they fail--after only 30,000 miles or so).
But that label on the back has me wondering *why* these parts aren't intended for use in the US.  Is this a manufacturing specification issue because of the lax pollution controls down there?  Do the US cars run leaner (and cleaner), making the coils have to work harder?  Are these made to  a lesser standard?  Are they more likely to break down when exposed to the kind of cold temperatures the US sees and Mexico doesn't?  Or is it just a matter of a licensing agreement that Delco doesn't have for producing these for sale in the US?
A million possibilities are clouding my mind.  Does anyone here have any insight?
The car in question is a '98 Crown Victoria.",2
"A review no one cares about: 18 months and 20k miles in a boosted BMW
To skip the preamble and get straight to my ownership impressions, please scroll to the break below. 
About a year and a half ago, I found myself on the hunt for a new (and my first ""serious"") vehicle. Now, I'm sure most of us on this sub are in some sort of perpetual state of window shopping for their next set of wheels and I am no different, but this time I was shopping with the intent to purchase. As such, I had doubled my research efforts trying to find the ""perfect"" car.  
Being a younger man, I opted to sacrifice practicality for fun; my previous cars included an incredibly sporty B5.5 VW Passat with a 1.8 liter turbo'd 4-banger. While it wasn't fast per se, it was plenty quick to get me in trouble (it never happened, knock on wood). It also provided me with a platform that was ripe for tuning, and would prove to be my first exposure to car modification. With a mild tune (APR), the car really livened up and sparked something in me; I wanted every car from this point forward to be modified to reach its full potential. 
After a number of years, my circumstances changed and I found having a vehicle to be impractical, so I let the Passat go. Fortunately, after only a very brief time spent as a carless shell of a human being, I found myself in a B6 Audi A4. Similar deal, mild tune, slightly lowered, etc. (I still maintain that this body style and interior was timeless, it really held up well over the years). After several more years of happy ownership, I finally landed a proper ""adult"" job with a paycheck to match. Naturally, my thoughts turned to the Audi which, at this point, had accumulated in excess of 190k miles. So I started to do what I did best: Window shop. 
Initially, I wanted to stay in an Audi. I really liked their interiors, and I was familiar with the company as a whole. I started to look at the S4 (B8, with the 3.0 supercharged 6) but quickly found that they held their value well, even at higher mileage. Couple this with the fact that finding a manual was impossible and the fact that early DSG units had issues, I had to scratch the idea. 
M-cars and P-cars were out of budget unless I wanted one that had been treated poorly, so I started to broaden my search. I was acutely aware of the fact that Asian makes had a huge aftermarket support, but having been spoiled by the Audi I couldn't overlook the plastic interiors. So I turned to the American manufacturers in the hopes that the cheap power offered by their cars could sway me over. I really liked the new Mustang that had just come out, and the Camaro has looked good to me since I first saw it in the Transformers movie. And yet, there was a problem: having lived near military bases my whole life, I couldn't shake the feeling that these cars were more common than Honda Civics, mostly because they were. You can certainly customize it to your heart's desire, but at the end of the day, you still have the same car as 50 other people in as many miles. 
So the hunt was on for something unique, something that very few people had heard of.  Ironically enough, I found it in the parking lot of the local Hyundai dealer as I drove by; a flash of blue from the back corner of the used car lot caught my eye, so I turned around and laid eyes on my car. It had a short wheelbase, aggressive camber and a snout that only a mother would love; it was the 135i. From the moment I sat behind the wheel, I was in love. Everything was where it should be, the seats were comfortably bolstered, the steering wheel felt great, and perhaps best of all, there was no stupid in-dash screen. It was a sports car, as simple as it could get. 
Taking it for a test drive was a blast. The car had incredible road feel and the steering response and feedback blew my old German tugboat out of the water. And the power...! 3 liters of twin-turbo'd goodness was enough to make me cackle like a fool. It was at this moment I fully understood where the BMW-driver stereotype came from; the car made me feel like anything was possible, I had only to plant my foot and I could feel myself elevate to immortal status. Okay, that's a bit dramatic, but doubling the power of my daily felt incredible. 
So I bought it. Mileage on the odometer: 37k. Price out the door: Just shy of $18k. Not bad for a car that retailed at $52k.
-------------------------------------------------------------
So after 20k miles, how have things held up? Simply put, remarkably. For being the hallmark of unreliability, the N54 engine has been absolutely stalwart for me. After owning the car for a bit, that old spark pushed me to mess with things a bit, so I started with an intake and JB4 piggyback tuner. That led itself to downpipes, charge pipe, blow off valve and a backend ECU flash which is how the car sits now. All said and done, I've been running nearly double the factory boost for a year now. Certainly, parts are more expensive that others, but if you shop smart there are deals a-plenty. When I bought the car, I told myself that I would use it as a vehicle to teach myself how to wrench, and I've stayed true to that as much as possible. With the exception of tires, I've done all the work myself in my home garage and have accumulated quite the collection of tools in the process all while keeping expenses down. Coming up on 60k, there are some weak points in the engine, namely the water pump/thermostat. I'm planning on preemptively replacing both shortly. Additionally, the valve train is due for a walnut blasting (one of the curses of direct injection), something that I'll probably have to have done. 
For those that argue that BMW ownership is expensive, my classic case is when I redid the valve cover gasket. Just for grins, I got a price quote from the dealership to the tune of $1k. The gasket itself was $50 and required 3 hours of sweat on my end. So, yes, owning a higher mileage BMW can be expensive if you make it that way. Granted, this approach isn't for everyone, and I understand the limitations that different situations place on owners. I'm very fortunate in that I'm able to pursue my passion in my own garage. 
This writeup wouldn't be complete without a word to ownership culture, and what I mean by that is how people treat me when they see a young guy in a fast eurocar. There is no denying that I catch a LOT of flak for this. The number of times I've heard something to the extent of ""parents must love you"" or some other implication that I didn't work my ass off to get the car is astronomically absurd. People see the Roundel and automatically assume that the car is expensive, and to be fair it was when it was new. I've had conversations with friends who dropped nearly $30k for a loaded econobox who still think I paid double that for my car. They simply cannot believe that my car cost less than theirs. 
Now, the ultimate thing, do I let it bother me? Mostly no. I'm able to shrug or laugh off most stuff, but there are times it really wears on me. I don't make it a point to be a douche and I don't go out of my way to tell people I drive a Bimmer, but people love to rag on the car even after I've explained exactly what it is that I love about my car. The conclusion I've come to: Dicks will be dicks, and there is nothing I or anyone else can do about it, so I don't let it bother me. 
Conversely, those who know what the 1-er is generally get excited when they see my car. In my current city, there are only 3 other 135is that I know of. I can count all of them that I have seen total on two hands, so it really fit the ""unique car"" bill. The styling isn't for everyone, but it has really grown on me. Plenty of people have asked me what exactly I drive, as they haven't ever heard of the 1-series. Sure, there are some rock chips and scrapes here and there, but she still cleans up really nicely. 
Moving forward, my plan is to continue to full bolt-on status and then look at aftermarket turbos. The goal is to have a reliable 500 horsepower daily driver that I can take to the track and tour the country.
I can almost guarantee that nobody cares about the opinions of a stranger on the internet (and I can guarantee less will have read this far), but this is beyond question the best car that I have ever driven and I love sharing my enthusiasm with others. Thanks for reading!

"2014 Mustang - Collision Repairs Scam
February 22nd was set to be an ideal day; beautiful weather, finished homework, and an afternoon spent detailing my car after school. I was on FL121 headed north, it was 6:55 AM, and the day was set to go well at school. I had just passed a county line, and was in a long line of cars going 60 - 65 mph. The car in front swerved a little, and that's when I saw the deer - standing perfectly still on the shoulder of the road. Within a second, it jumped into the road, and I smashed into it, causing the deer to tear through the crash structures of the passenger side, and eventually I ran it over. I called the Florida Highway Patrol, and had an incident report written, as well as my nerves calmed - this was the first major road accident I had ever been involved in! I then called my insurance company, Gieco, and was reassured that they would handle everything, even the towing. They recommended a shop in the area, who was part of their Direct Repair Program (DRP), otherwise known as ""Auto Repair Xpress"". I consented to have my vehicle towed their for inspection and repair, and set about to calling my parents for help - after all, who else can you call?
This started the months long saga, detailed below:
February 22nd (Day 1):
After the tow, I was at G. Collision Center, awaiting a call from my adjuster. I took these photos:

[Kinked Aluminum Hood]http://imgur.com/Qqo8BR3
I spoke with my claims manager there, apparently an experienced autobody worker, and pointed out areas of concern - especially the kinked hood, the warped/mangled metal shoved into the tire, fender alignment, and suspension issues. I was told ""We'll look into it"". At this point, I signed the consent forms, and left.
February 23rd (Day 2):
I'm reassigned an adjuster, and the shop tore down the car and was estimated at $3000 in repairs. I had my adjuster fix the quote to include the correct headlight, $3300. They are fixing the hood, putting aftermarket body parts. I call my adjuster, and make my request for OEM parts quite clear. He says he'll get back with me.
February 24th (Day 3): Adjuster calls, he's authorizing some of the components to be OEM - Yay! He also updated the Estimate of Record. [Estimate](http://i.imgur.com/8bVmUPG.png)
February 26-March 2 (Days 4-8): I called the shop asking for updates, as they were supposed to update online, but failed to ever do so. I point out errors that I see as they're going through - scraped A-pillar, scraped rocker panel, incorrect structure repair. I swung by the shop to see the car and collect some belongings, and noticed these errors on parts they said were ""done"". I called my adjuster to raise my concern with the radiator support, and was assured that it would be handled. [On the rack](http://i.imgur.com/nTWP8oz.jpg)
March 3rd (Day 9): The original completion date comes up, the car isn't ready. They were supposedly waiting on parts to come in that they did not realize were broken, despite tearing down the car before starting repairs and notating ""everything"". 
March 8th (Day 14):
I called 5 days after that, and it's supposed to be ready. I drive the hour and 45 minutes to the shop, and it isn't ready. At this point, I'm told to be patient (sitting at the 2 week mark). There was still the scrape in the A-pillar, the paint job was terrible, the foglight was missing, and the undersheild was also missing - apparently the car wassn't supposed to have one according to my experience claims manager at the body shop. I also point out a huge dent in the new fender that was ""normal"", and that the hood did not sit right on the car, which was met with ""those are small adjustments that aren't even worth looking at"". He also tells me that he only drove it down the street and back, at low speeds. I'm furious, and send a terse email to my adjuster asking him to handle those issues, and to only have the shop call me when it's ready and safe to drive.

March 9th (Day 16): Come Friday, the manager called me to tell me the car is ready. I have my parents drive me to the shop (it was Spring Break), I pay for it, and pick it up. I noticed some rattling, but didn't figure there'd be any issues that couldn't wait until after spring break. They've run $6,700 in repairs, but so far, they've used all OEM parts, to their credit. $300 headlight bulbs, $300 ballast, $1000 projector housing, labor to adjust, bumper, fender, both grills, radiator baffle, brackets, structure repair, wheel alignment... When I arrived, the hood closed sensor was not attached, the hood didn't line up still, the scrape to the A-pillar was still there, the paint didn't match, there was a small buckle in the fender apron I noticed was left unpainted - I requested they fix that so it didn't rust, and they huffily agreed - getting overspray on EVERYTHING in the process. I also noticed the maladjusted headlight - pointed significantly higher than the old one, after being supposedly sent to the dealership for alignment.
March 11th (Day 18): I take it for a trip down the coast with my girlfriend. The speed limits were pretty low, and I never exceeded 55 mph on the way there. On the way back, I attempted to go faster on a different route, and that's when the hood tried to come off. I freaked out, and called Geico, who promptly sent out a person to tow the vehicle back to the first body shop. As it was the weekend, there was 2 days of storage fees ($180), and eventually, I found out, a $720 tow bill for 200 miles. I got a sweet dinner at the beach, waiting for my folks to get there, and I had a good time after being stressed about the car.
March 13th (Day 20): I get a very worried call from my adjuster, who assures me that the shop will make it right. I asked about a rental, but was assured the repairs would be less than a couple days. I didn't speak with the shop at all. I was also told that the shop (G. Collision Center) would be handling the cost of the tow, which worked out not to be the case. 
March 14th (Day 21): I get a call from the shop's manager, who was very angry with me, and told me to come collect my car, as it was ready. I showed up, after graciously being dropped off by a friend, and noticed the hood still didn't sit right, and that the other issues were never addressed. He told me that I was trying to scam his shop out of a new hood, and told me to get my ""shitty"" car out of his shop, this was as good as he would make it. I collected my keys, and promptly called my adjuster. He then informed me that I could take it wherever I chose - I was armed with more knowledge at this time, and took it to a non - DRP shop, who is certified by Mercedes, Ford, and Hyundai to do factory warranty work - they came extremely well reviewed online, and I drove the car to them after making an appointment. They found lots of horrifying unrepaired structural damage.

April 3rd (Day 41): I made it to my appointment at the new shop (B. Paint and Autobody). They reviewed everything, took my keys, and sent me off to get a rental. Surprise surprise, guess who pays out the rental, per their **contract** with Geico? You guessed it! G. Collision Center! They've put me up in a Hyundai Sonata - its mine for the next 30 days. The contract states $30/day, so that is an additional $900 just for a rental car. 
April 14th (Day 52): I get a call from my claims manager - he asks me to come by the shop. I swing by, and he points out everything they found, and tells me that he will be repainting everything - rocker panel, a pillar, fender, bumper, and blending into the door. They'll also be replacing the radiator support, fender rail, and fender apron, and also possibly the hood - turns out, you're not supposed to use regular old bondo on an aluminum body panel. So with replacing all of that, putting it on a frame machine, and putting it on an alignment rack, they should be able to have it back to pre-accident condition. Ballpark, he said, was 4 to 5 thousand dollars at minimum, perhaps more. I won't have my car back until April 28th, or 66 days. 
April 20th: 
I just got an email from my claims manager at the new/second body shop - $5600 suppliment, minimum of 7 working days from today. I asked for a copy of the suppliment.
I will continue to update this for those interested. The lesson to take away from this, as a consumer, is that you should not take it to a contracted repair facility - they are under a **contract** with your insurance carrier to get you out for the minimum dollar spent. Indeed, they don't work for you, they work for your insurance. Also, make sure you have rental coverage-it's literally a few dollars over 6 months, and takes away all the stress of not having a car. All in, this repair has tallied up: $65 initial tow, $6700 in initial repairs, $500 deductible, $900 tow bill, $900 rental, $5000 second repair, and the potential for more. For those without calculators, that is $14,065. Don't hit deer, don't take guff from your insurance, and **do** make sure you check out your insurance policy. ",2
"I drove the North Coast 500 (NC500) with 4 friends, we had a blast. Here are the photos of our adventures
[Link to album](http://imgur.com/gallery/Q5OcQ)
Apologies in advance as not all the photos are car related, but as it was a road trip, I felt it important to capture, and share the overall things we experienced along the way.
I can completely recommend the NC500 to any car enthusiast. So many winding roads, so much open space and mountain scenery. Just be wary of other tourists and bikers, they do come out of nowhere on some of the bends.
I would say I had one of the best times of my life driving some of those roads in convoy with friends. The desire to follow the chase from crest to crest was strong, and utterly thrilling all the way.
My friend Andrew has compiled a little teaser video putting together various clips from the week long trip, this can be viewed [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kSdHUjih0A)]
Along with my 8 minute long Applecross Pass video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCpGqh9gTPg), and here for the [rear camera view](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oS4Tl4-0nKQ) showing just how tedious this pass can be when busy. Beautiful view from the top though.
In total, my mileage came to 1984,and my M3's OBD read 25MPG average from the entire trip. I was getting 32MPG on the drive up, but this dropped as our journey began in the mountains.
It never let me down, in fact I did break something on it, the headlight angle sensor bar that attaches to the front wishbone must have been hit by one of the many stones littering the single track roads, as it sheered off its henge at the clamp. £40 later and I fitted a new one.
If you go in a convoy, keep sizeable distance from each other if driving spirited,stones will get kicked up to windscreen height. Two of my friends got bad stone chips, one has a long crack. Both will need new windscreens from this.
Worth noting that there is very little to no data connection around most of the Highlands outside of town areas. At a few points I did see 3G on the Three network, but the moment you moved off the peak of the hill, it was gone.
Fuel is also something you will need to plan your jaunts around. I averaged up to 350 miles to a tank, and our average mileage per day was something like 150-200 max. Finding a Torq/Gleamer or Jet is the best option for those who require Super Unleaded. Gleamer's SUL is 98 octane. I understand it's similar to what Shell used to be before they changed to V Power Nitro+.

"What is the most fun you have had in a car?
It doesn't matter if it is a high end exotic sports car or a soccer mom mid-size crossover, what was your most fun experience you've ever had in an automobile? 
For me, nothing beats my friend's first car, a hand-me-down 2003 Accent. That thing was pretty much indestructible. He was given it when he got his permit and sold it when he got his girlfriend pregnant. It lasted him 5 years of hard abuse and didn't break a sweat.
* 1.6 liter 4 banger
* 2,200 lbs.
* 104 My Little Ponies
* A whole whopping 1272 inch pounds to tire shredding torque.
We rallycrossed it, drag raced it, did epic lunch tray skids, chopped off the muffler, custom dryer vent cold air intake. He jumped that thing over this one railroad crossing every time he drove on that road. One time He hit that jump with his girlfriend in the car. She hit the roof, dislodged her tongue piercing, choking on and swallowing it. She pooped it out the next day. The synchros were gone on all the gears and the clutch slipped when he tried launching it. One night he was tired and falling asleep when he didn't notice a big box on the highway full of metal scraps. It ripped off the bumper and destroyed the condenser and radiator. It was like 2 A.M. and he wasn't about to stop in the middle of nowhere to wait for a tow, so he drove it home while it pissed coolant. Made it to the foot of his driveway before the head gasket blew. It was out of commission for a few weeks while he swapped the engine and trans with a dropout from a wreck. $450 including tax and shipping to his front door.
He got his first ""real"" job that was so close to home that he would usually walk in decent weather and didn't really drive it. He then found out his girlfriend was pregnant and he bought a really clean G35 sedan that he still has today. The dealership that he bought it at offered him $100 for it. Haha.",2
"My ‘Year at a Glance’ ownership experience of an Alfa Romeo 4C!
Hey all, after seeing countless posts roasting the 4C I figured it was about time I try and break down (no pun intended) what people seem to think are issues and apply them to my experience as an Owner and Driving Enthusiast.          First off the preliminaries:        My Alfa was bought a year ago off of an older Italian Gentleman hailing from the West Coast of Canada. He bought it brand new off the lot for retail price (around 90k Canadian) in 2016. Over the two years of him owning it he put around 5k Kilometres on it and rarely let anyone in the passenger seat. He was incredibly meticulous with everything about it and I believe that contributed to my own experiences with it thus far.             Enter me: Finding the posting by this Man on Craigslist, I was initially skeptical about it as the selling price was 65k, an absolute steal from what the retail price was at the time. Once I met him and the 4C I knew that it was mine. After severely denting my Bank account I was able to take it home and could not stop pinching myself. To this day I can honestly say it was so worth it!               Initially I told myself I would only drive it on the weekends: That thought process changed quickly as I could not get out of the damn thing.      I said once Winter came I would park it: Nope, I drove it whenever the weather permitted.       It couldnt possibly be a daily driver could it? Oh Yes it can! Granted I do have a slim build and my work commute is only about 20 minutes.          The Milage is starting to stack up though, It is currently at 25k and growing steadily. Ive taken it for a service and the bolt retorque once each, with the service costs coming to ~700 dollars (I provided the oil and filter) and retorque coming to 1100.      Other costs include tires: Continental Extremecontacts (1400 for 4)as the original Pirelli P Zeros I was unhappy with, an aftermarket Intake(350), as I felt the stock airbox was not attractive looking and too bulky, and new Intercooler tubing(300).     Total costs just under 4k for the year.           Ive honestly been surprised with how its treated me so far. I know some other Alfa owners have had no end to issues but I have come through unscathed! Apologies for the wall of text! Let me know if you have any questions! Pictures in the comments!",2
"Can we talk about the hate at the Veyron?
Lately ive seen SOOO much hate towards the car. People say its hideous or its the ugliest car in the world or think its a piece of shit. I dont understand, especially when the car was revealed back in 2005, EVERYONE was drooling over its looks and performance, they still do to this day. I know some people that were in love with the car but now they hate it for no good reason.
Here are some facts (correct me if im wrong):
The Veyron isnt just famous for its top speed, blistering acceleration and performance but also the technology that allows the car to do what most cars in its class cannot. Its a Road Yacht. Bring me any car that can do the all of the above and I would put my money down that it wouldn't be as comfortable and quiet as the Veyron. If you tell me a modified Gallardo or GTR would smash this car then I wont disagree, but remember that the Veyron can do that over and over and over without breaking when those ones might break any minute. Im sure most people that hate the car probably have never seen one in person, I used to think the front end looked ugly then I saw it in person and changed my mind. 
Im writing this because I recently had the chance of going to look at and ride one of my uncle's friend's new Veyron. I dont have pictures since his friend asked us not to take pictures for personal reasons. 
Finally, I have to say that the car is a technological achievement. Its the car that inspired other companies to create a good rivalry with the car and I think this car deserves A LOT of respect. 
TL:DR Why so much hate? &#3232;_&#3232;

"My journey to leasing an Alfa Romeo Giulia (also known as I test drove way too many cars)
Ok, first things first, it isn't brand new anymore; I just now got photos back from my amateur photographer friend so I thought now would be a good time to post photos/my thoughts on the segment/brag.
[Second, pictures.
](https://imgur.com/a/4Y7bc) It is a 2017 Giulia with the sports package (and nothing else). 39 month lease with 12000 miles/year. And it took me a while, but I've name my car Im (pronounced ""M""). Why Im? A friend called it my Italian Mistress and I got a kick out of that. My girlfriend still calls it Alfy because she likes to give me pain.
Up until May 1st of this year, I was driving the same truck I had been since I was in high school: 2005 Ford F150 Texas edition. It was a great truck that gave me everything I needed for almost 150,000 miles with very few issues (the belts used to control the windows broke probably 6 times between the 4 doors and the windshield fluid sprayer broke once, but I don't recall anything else other than routine maintenance). But I was finally making money and decided I wanted something that was a different type of fun. Now, I am not a dyed in the wool car guy like many on this sub; my parents always had nice vehicles, but my dad runs a small commercial contracting business so, outside of his 197-something Gremlin that he was so fond of, I think all he's ever owned are various trucks. Because of this, my knowledge of cars largely originates from haphazardly marathoning multiple seasons of Top Gear/The Grand Tour earlier this year and picking the brain of a friend of mine that is definitely a dyed in the whole car guy (who also happens to be the amateur photographer).
As someone completely knew to the segment (and cars in general), I did some fairly intense research and test driving. I ended up test driving a Giulia (obviously), a 3 series, an A4, a C class, an XE, an ATX, and an IS. Just as general background, I was looking for a daily driver (my office is less than a mile from where I work, but my family lives several hundred miles away and my gf currently lives over a hundred miles away as well) and I would probably say my priorities when I was looking for a car were looks/how much they stand out, how fun it was to drive, how comfortable it was to drive, and how good the infotainment was (really narrowing it down for you, I know). I ended up test driving everything except the ATS, A4, and the 3 series at least twice, partially to help me decide and partially because I wanted to see what various people thought about each car. I'll put my thoughts about each car in order from the one I liked the least to the one I liked the best. Some of my thoughts on each car are gone at this point, as I've been relentlessly lazy with regards to finally making this post, but I'll do my best to recreate my  thoughts as I had looking at each car. I'll have a TL;DR for the reviews at the end as well.
**ATS**
Ok, my least favorite car was the ATS. All cars in this segment are great, but there isn't a doubt in my mind that this car was the one that appealed to me the least. In my opinion, this segment can be more or less described as a continuum of cars that are somewhere between a luxury car trying to be a sporty car and a sporty car trying to be a luxury car. The ATS felt the most like a luxury car trying to be (even if only at a perfunctory level) sporty to me. It had a deep, sonorous engine that felt more like towing power than raw speed. The inside looked great, perhaps the most luxurious interior in the class. The outside was definitely stately. But it felt and looked too much like a powerful boat for my tastes. Even though this was the third car I test drove, I think it may have been pivotal in pushing me over to the ""sporty car trying to be a luxury car"" end of the segment, because this car just did not speak to me when driving it. Perhaps, in 30 years, it will be exactly what I want. Just not now.
I also didn't much like a lot of the things going on inside. It was beautiful, but I felt like the center consul was too high, making my right arm uncomfortable. Additionally, I am not a fan of touch screen infotainment. I want to be able to focus on driving when I'm driving, not fumbling around, stretching to touch ""next station"".
**A4**
Now, after saying I was pushed to the sporty end of the segment, I of course have to rate lowly one of the more sporty cars, the A4. Now, the general, albeit definitely not word-of-God, consensus among car reviews I had read was that the A4 was the top or very close to the top of the segment. Plus, compared to the couch-on-wheels ATS, it is much more on the sport side of the spectrum, yet I rate it very, very low. Why? Three reasons (one of which is often brought up by the professional reviewers. 
First: professional reviewers are correct in saying that you almost feel removed from the driving experience when you are in the A4. I don't know how to say it much better than that: the steering wasn't as tight or responsive as I wanted it, I didn't feel overly excited when I tried to gun it, and, personally, I thought all the cool tech in the car was a draw back that removed you from the driving experience. It felt like you were in a driving sim. 
Second, I didn't like the cool tech at all. I felt it was overwhelming (not in that I am tech-illiterate, but in that I want to drive, not play on a computer). I didn't like the Nav jumping over in front of the driver (I just want to see my speedometer, come on). I didn't like the placement of the infotainment controls because the stick is in the way. I don't want to try to change the radio station and suddenly switch in to reverse on the highway. But, like some people disagreeing that the ATS is too far on the luxury end of the segment, I am sure people will disagree as the amount of tech you want in a car at least partially comes down to preference. Add in to that the fact that I think sticking an iPad on the dashboard looks ugly, and this car quickly got knocked off my list.
Finally, and I'm sure A LOT of people will disagree with this, I found the exterior styling to be lack luster. It doesn't stand out in a crowd, and I didn't think it looked all that much better than any of the cars in the cheaper segments.
**3-Series**
I have to admit, the 3-series was the most disappointing to me. As someone only recently taking an interest in cars, the 3-series was the car I had heard the most about and thought the most of. I was expecting, in the words of Reinhart, [precision German engineering.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ack8pgkH_NU) Rather, the 3-series kind of suffered from the same lack of real driving feel that the A4 did. It did everything right but it just felt... blah. It looked right, but at this point, everyone and their mother (in Houston) drives a BMW, so it didn't stand out. The infotainment had a good balance of features and not separating you from driving, but I don't really remember being impressed (although, I will repeat that sticking an iPad on the dash is dumb). And as lame as it is to sum up the 3-series as blah... that's how I felt. Maybe I should have tried the M badged one or a 330 instead, but BMW lost me before that point.
**C Class**
This is the car that doesn't fit in with my ""last few cars"" that somehow made it there. Once again, drifting closer to the ""luxury car trying to be sporty"" end of the spectrum, but I felt like the C Class was on the right side of it. If the ATS was driving a tug boat with a low, powering engine, I felt like the C Class was a midsized boat with a good balance of luxury and sport. In terms of the interior, it was right there with the ATS. My two main qualms with the interior being the iPad on the dash (I really wish everyone would stop doing that) and the lack of a stick for the drive modes (I'm not a fan of the little dial to choose drive). The AMG version had a really good looking midnight combination available (I don't remember what it was called, but you can imagine what it looked like). I also believe it had some sort of phone to nav compatibility, but I could be wrong (this was one of the things I hoped more cars in the class would have standard). I recall the steering being heavy but responsive, which I liked. It had a sports and a sports plus mode, which helped it inch closer to the sporty end of the spectrum. Additionally, the idea of driving a Benz appealed to me at some level. It ended up just not being enough to really make last few cars.
**THE FINAL CONTENDERS**
These are the last 3 cars, all of which I was very close to at one point to getting. If you're tired of reading my thoughts, it'll probably only get longer. Sorry in advance.
**XE 35T**
For a while, I was almost sold on the Jag, just waiting for the right one to come in. Why? Well, because Jag cheated. This was the only V6. As I originally test drove the 25T, I will give a short review of driving it (everything else is the same as the 35T). It was uninspiring. It didn't feel as powerful as the luxury boats of the class and didn't have the pick-up and go that the last two cars had.
Ok, that's out of the way. What I liked about the 35T: V6 power. It felt fast. It was fast. It was probably the best sounding of all the cars. It was just as exhilarating to drive as the Alfa (but in a different way). I thought the steering felt right; it wasn't too heavy and it was tight. 
It also, in my opinion, looked great. I liked the more aggressive design than most of the rest of the class. One color in particular, the deep blue, was absolutely gorgeous. It is more rare than any of the other cars on the list other than the Alfa, which I liked a bit as well. 
Also, its infotainment isn't an iPad sticking out of the freaking dash. It also had an app that let's you work with your phone for navigation (but you had to pay for the fully nav), which I loved. It was, however, touch screen, which is a big negative for me. Doesn't feel safe, and,e ven if you use the steering wheel controls, it is just too much going on while driving.
But the negative for this car is a big one, and probably the reason I didn't go with the XE: Unless you want to drop an extra 5k for the upgraded interior, it looks cheap inside. As a car starting at around 40000, I don't want to have a scowl on my face every time I open the door. I also don't like the spin wheel for drive selecting (but it did pop up and down when the car turned off and on, which was a nice touch).
Finally, sun roofs were not optional. Some people may think this is cool, but it doesn't have a hard plastic cover. This means that, if you live in the South, you have to deal with heat and sunlight always, because a flimsy little piece of cloth isn't going to cut it when it's 100+ degrees and the sun wants to shit in your eyes. To be fair, several of the cars in this segment have the same problem, but this is the one that I remember it about.
**IS 200T F-Sport**
Lexus did a lot of things right with this car. For the price, there are a lot of good safety features that come with it (auto break when reversing, lane control, etc.). I was also a fan how it drove. It didn't have the disconnected feel that the Audi and the BMW had; the steering was pretty tight, there was a good amount of power and acceleration, and it was actually fun to drive. The exterior was good; not as good as the Alfa or the Jag, but it is still a great looking car. I liked the extra ""edge"" the F-Sport gave everything. I really liked the interior if you picked the maroon leather/accents (my girlfriend strongly disagreed, unfortunately). The infotainment, although being an iPad, was stuffed into the consul rather than stuck on top of it. This was the car my girlfriend wanted me to get (the lame, non-maroon interior one, anyways).
But there were a few things I wasn't a fan of. First, although the infotainment wasn't touch screen, it was a weird combo of drawing on a little pad and a mouse, which was not good in my opinion. Also, I was told they had google car play/equivalent, and when they told me they were wrong, it only brought up the line by line instructions (rather than a map), I basically decided to go with the Alfa.
**Alfa Romeo Giulia**
The main event. Finally getting to the most controversial car in the segment, especially in this sub. If I had to sum it up, it would be ""the car is everything they say it is."" What do I mean by that? The exterior is beautiful. I know a lot of people don't like the trade-mark grill or this or that, but I really think it is the best looking car in the class. You *will* get stares everywhere. People will ask you about your car when you stop to get gas. People will want to race you at lights (well, in Houston they do that anyways because the drivers are dicks, but I assume at least one person has done it because of the car). You will smile when you see your car. You won't see anyone else on the roads with your car. It's like being the hot girl in the class; everyone looks at you and everyone looks at you differently. And it's great.
I love the interior. I didn't opt for the wooden inserts, but those really were breathtaking. Even for the poors like me, the aluminium looks really great. There was also a red leather interior option available (again vetoed by the lady), which I liked. The paddle shifters are single, large pieces of aluminium as well, which look a lot better (and a lot less likely to break) than the little plastic ones  some other cars in the class had. The infotainment isn't just an iPad! It's built in to the consul and looks natural rather than an afterthought. Also, at night there is a truly great soft (and adjustable) ambiance lighting.
Everything about the driving position is great. It is comfortable even on long distance drives (my experience is limited to about 300 miles in one go, but I think that's a pretty good indicator). The front seats are surprisingly roomy (the rear seats can get pretty tight, however).
As I've alluded to before, the driving is second to none in the class. As my girlfriend put it, she knew what I would choose because I had a goofy smile on my face the entire test drive. I felt like it accelerated better than anything else (barring the V6 Jag), and it also had the best handling. The balance of the steering wheel was perfect in my opinion.
Also, I think the infotainment is the best in class (I know a lot of people won't agree). It is intuitive. It doesn't require you to take your mind off the road. Each thing you can do is easy to feel. Even searching for contacts or songs is quick. The only real negatives I have about it is that 1) no google drive-type app available and 2) the quick-select song station thing is great, but could use a few more choices (6 would be enough for most, but I travel enough that it isn't and I have to mess with the favorites when I am in another city, which is 2-3 weekends per month).
The main thing I don't really like the car can be summed up on the one buzz word I've avoided this entire review: Reliability. I've had my car for 4.5 months and 4700 miles. I took it in once for optional software flashed (the dealership didn't even notify me they were available, someone mentioned it on reddit). A few days before my appointment, a CEL came on and went away on it's own about 2 days later (still before my apt). Not very inspiring. Other than that, however, I've had 0 issues.
Additionally, when compared to the IS, there aren't enough safety features that come standard. All those cool things that keep me from wrecking came with the Lexus for cheaper (albeit it was a former loaner car) than the Alfa was.
Finally, it is worth noting that the 2 worse dealership experiences I had were both Alfa (and I went to a freaking ton of dealerships). I ended up going to 4 different Alfa dealers (long story), but one wouldn't even let me test drive because they thought I was too poor (and then told me the leases start at $700/mo, which is a bold-faced lie, and gave us some perfunctory BS about why it was double other cars that cost the same MSRP). Another one I went to had a guy that summed up the different packages as ""well, some will increase the price, some won't, and it's different for every car."" Alfas were new, but he was obviously not very familiar with the product. He was a nice guy, just not prepared.
Anyways, 10 out of 10 times I would go with the Alfa again.
**
TL;DR:** 
ATS: I don't wanna drive a boat, I wanna drive a car.
Audi: I don't want to play a game, I wanna drive a car.
BMW: I don't wanna meh, I wanna car.
C Class: I don't want this much of a luxury car, I wanna sporty car.
Jag: I don't wanna pay for the interior of a car that looks like the basic package should look, I wanna luxury car.
Lexus: I don't wanna computer with a car around it, I want a car with a computer in it.
Alfa: I want an awesome car for my drive to the mechanic.

"How to stop immediately while driving a manual transmission car?
Hi,
I know that to speed up you go up the gears. And to slow down, some go down the gears and some put it on neutral and use the breaks.
What I want to know is what one should do if one has to stop immediately. (e.g. you will hit a car or a passenger in front of you and you need to stop immediately, regardless on the selected gear)
My intuition says you just slam the breaks (but I think that's wrong, maybe with the clutch down?)
(P.s. I don't own a car and I don't know how to drive, so sorry if my question is dumb. I'm just really curious)",2

"Is a Crown Victoria a good idea?
So, I'm searching for a car and one of the ones that has struck my interest is a P71 Crown Victoria. I've looked at a few of the other panther platform sedans (town car and grand marquis) but all of them seem to be donked or at 180k miles and the person selling it is super short with me. I found a 2004 Crown Vic with 133k miles for $1700 and the guy seems knowledgable about the car and is being super open about everything and is replying in depth and using proper grammar (idk why it makes me feel more comfortable when buying a car) and I think it may be a good car to get me through college.

"Dealership Damaged my Truck and is Refusing to Fully Repair the Damage
I took truck to the dealership to get an oil change; I know dealerships are overpriced, but I like the peace of mind knowing that my vehicle is in good hands (or so I thought). When I picked up the truck I noticed that my mirror was in a different position and I thought to myself ""they must have had to move it for better visibility"", so I drove off the lot and went home. The following day at a gas station I went to move the mirror back to its rightful position and noticed that the whole side of the mirror was damaged, the housing for a turn signal light was cracked and there were multiple scratches on the bed of the truck. I called the dealer asking to speak to the service manager to let them know they damaged my vehicle and they told me they would check the security cameras and get back to me shortly. After about 4 hours of no response I decided to call back and after being transferred to the service manager the call almost immediately went to voicemail.
Being impatient I decided to drive my truck to the dealership to at least make them aware of the extent of the damage. After  waiting about 15 minutes for the service manager to be found he came out and explained that they could not see my truck on tape while it was in the garage, but he assured me that the damage was not their fault. After a few back and forth's he said that he would replace the mirror and buff out the scratches. I pointed out that the scratches were through the clear coat and paint correction would need to be performed. He told me that he was ""cutting me a break"" by replacing the mirror.  After I explained that the damage was clearly their fault, and I would file a police report if the damages were not fully rectified he told  me that he wouldn't be so ""nice"" if I went to the police.
He gave me his word that he would order the mirror and see what he could do about the scratches. In my opinion, he knows that he is at fault but does not want to cover the costs  for the full damage done to my vehicle. He said that he would get back to me tomorrow to see what can be done with the other scratches.
I still believe that I am being mistreated by this dealership and I am strongly considering filing a police report and risking my insurance rates for the  principal of the matter. Does anyone have similar experience with dealers mistreating them or any advice with how to navigate this issue?  It's not fair that someone who absolutely babies their vehicle is told that the damage that was caused by someone else is their fault. Needless to say, if my vehicle is not fully repaired I will be writing incredibly negative (yet honest) reviews on  their dealership.

\- Thanks for any advice.
**Update:**
Thank you for all of your comments. After making another trip to the dealership to try to watch the footage of the vehicle entering and leaving the garage the service manager called me into his office. After sitting down and letting him know that I am still very certain that his dealership caused the damage to my truck and I wasn't going to back down until the entire vehicle was repaired back to it's original shape; he decided to cut me a deal. Today he mentioned that the mirror was in fact their fault (because of the noticeable paint on my mirror). Which I thought was odd because yesterday he seemed positive that they did not cause the damage to the mirror. Anyway, he told me that he ordered the new mirror and it'd be here on Friday. As for the paint on the bed of the truck he said he was willing to send it off to get the paint corrected by their body shop as early as next week. He offered to give me a rental for the week; however, I declined the option of a rental car due to my traveling schedule being quite hectic (he seemed most happy with the fact they didn't have to set me up with a car).
Hopefully the damage will be fully repaired (he gave me his word that they would fix it), and we can put this issue behind us. I learned a valuable lesson this week, which is to make sure you inspect your vehicle before claiming it and take pictures to ensure any damage done is by the dealership. Additionally, I will be purchasing a dash cam to prevent any future incidents from being disputed.
For anyone in a similar situation, my advice is to stay calm and don't back down. Dealerships will try to intimidate you, but if you are confident that the dealership should be held accountable for something don't back down! Keep pressuring them until either they start to work with you or get other outside forces involved (police, BBB, review sites, etc). I appreciate all your help throughout this process and hopefully the work completely resolves this issue. Thanks.",2
"[OC] Dispelling the myth that Americans uniquely dislike manual transmission – The opposite might be true!
**TLDR at bottom**
So, you hang out long enough in car forums, and eventually you’ll see sentiment like this: “Damned [other] American drivers, hating manual transmission, if Americans didn’t hate manual so much, I can get [insert car here] in manual!” This usually shows up in discussions about how certain car models are losing the manual transmission, or in reviews of new cars when someone says something along the lines of “I’d love to buy [insert car], but it doesn’t come in manual”. 
Plenty of people seem to believe that Americans (and Canadians I guess) uniquely dislike manual transmission, that consumers outside of North America like manuals. Many different explanations are given by various different people about why this phenomenon exists, yet the idea that north American buyers uniquely hate manual has almost never been questioned. After all, 2% of new cars sold in the US today are manual.
Well I’m not denying that buyers in North American are more likely to buy automatic, but I’ve always thought the idea that only buyers in North America hate manual transmission is a myth. Today, I’m going to prove that North American buyers don’t uniquely dislike manual transmission, that the same phenomenon exists in similar forms in two other key markets (China and Germany). I will also show that there exists evidence the opposite might even be true, enthusiasts in North Americans uniquely love manual transmission.
Let’s start with China, they are the world’s biggest country, and the world’s biggest automotive market by number of cars sold. [The market share for automatics in China is around 70%](https://www.jiemian.com/article/1719103.html), way lower than in the United States, but let’s break down the numbers shall we?
I went on China’s well known automotive website Autohome (think Chinese Car and Driver) to look for cars. First thing I did, was to look at the sports car category, set the filter to manual transmissions only, and I got, [nothing. Well, ok, not exactly nothing, but you get a bunch of Morgans, and that weird X-Bow thing made by KTM, the motorcycle company.](https://car.autohome.com.cn/price/list-0-7-0-0-1-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-1.html) 
Yep, that’s right, with the discontinuation of the Toyota 86 (2017 was the last model year), not a single sports car in China is sold with manual. What about the Mustang you ask? Automatic only. The Camaro? Automatic only. BMW M2? Auto only. 718? Same thing, automatic only. 
Of course, you can get base Civics, Corollas, Cavaliers (Chevy’s volume compact is the Cavalier in China), etc in manual. But let’s say, I want a car with some basic luxuries. So I went back to the search page, and looked for a manual transmission car with a few basic features that one would consider “premium” in 2018: Leather powered seats, cruise control, LED headlights, and automatic climate control. [What I got was 1 car in the whole Chinese market, some crappy FWD SUV that is never sold outside of China](https://car.autohome.com.cn/price/list-0-0-0-0-1-0-0-0-0-2_6_7_9_13-0-0-0-0-0-1.html#!). (It is also a pretty blatant Acura ripoff, it even has the beak haha). You can’t even find a car with heated seats with manual in China.
Think about it for a second. If Chinese people like manual transmission, why can’t you get a manual sports car? If Chinese people like manual transmission, why can’t you get a car that is equipped with the most basic options with manual? The only way this makes sense IMO is that the majority of Chinese customers dislike manual, the only reason why manual’s market share is higher is because there are plenty of people who cannot afford the automatic option. In fact, the moment you start adding even the most basic options, you can’t get manual anymore. Why? Because overall, Chinese consumers prioritize automatic to the point where, if they can only afford a single option, it would be the automatic transmission.
Now let’s take a look at Germany, I picked them as an example because they have a strong domestic automotive industry, and that German automobiles are exported worldwide, including to North America. So I went on the German website mobile.de to look at listings (AKA, cars currently advertised for sale), and overall, 58% of new car listings are manual. Hey, that’s pretty good for manual transmissions you’d think! But let’s dig a bit further.
Let’s start with sports cars shall we? So I selected the sports cars and convertibles option, and immediately the manual transmission rate drops to 31%. Now the rate is probably actually even lower because this weird [Piaggio APE Calessino Euro 4 3 wheeled thing](https://suchen.mobile.de/fahrzeuge/details.html?id=266939234&categories=Cabrio&categories=SportsCar&damageUnrepaired=NO_DAMAGE_UNREPAIRED&isSearchRequest=true&pageNumber=1&scopeId=C&usage=NEW&fnai=next&searchId=74bb0a1b-ef47-f5e2-66b3-03eb5f83503e) that only comes in manual counts as a “convertible”, which I don’t think counts as a car for obvious reasons (There’s also a huge number of manual Beetle, Smart, and Fiat 500 listings, cars I don’t necessarily consider sports cars). Hmm, so overall, German sports car drivers prefer automatic over manual? This almost seems like the opposite of what we see in North America. 
Let’s dig in a little bit deeper and break it down shall we? Overall, 26.1% of Audi, 20.9% of BMW, and 8.59% of Mercedes Benz listings are manual. But remember, in Germany (unlike many export markets), these brands aren’t necessarily “luxury”, they also sell lower specced entry level vehicles (IE: The 318i with cloth interior). If we were to limit these brands to their higher priced offerings only, the manual rate again drops sharply. 
Above 50 thousand euros, only 1.01% of Audi, 1.97% of BMW, and 0.09% of Mercedes Benz listings are manual, in line with manual take rates in the United States. In fact, once you consider Porsche (a company that doesn’t sell cars cheaper than 50 thousand dollars/euros), American Porsche buyers are slightly more likely to buy manuals, 3.87% of German listings are manual, but 4.13% of American ones (on autotrader) are. 
Now if you go and search German sports car and convertible listings above 50 thousand euros, only 11% of them are manual. Interestingly enough, more than a quarter of them are Mustangs, and nearly 16% of them are Chevrolet Camaros and Corvettes (Chevrolet literally has 5 dealers in all of Germany). There are currently 27 manual BMW sports cars or convertibles being advertised in Germany above the price of 50 thousand at this moment. Zero Mercedes Benz, and 3 Audis. If we use 50 thousand as the threshold for ""high end"", the German big 3 has a total of 30 high end sports cars for sale. Adding in Porsche, the big 4 German luxury brands have a total of 102 high end sports cars for sale. In comparison, if we search high end sports cars above $50 thousand USD (I know it is lower than 50 thousand euros, but european prices contain tax), 15% of them are manual on autotrader, and a good number of them are Audi's and BMWs. 
So I would conclude that German buyers are in a way similar to American and Chinese buyers in that they don’t show preference for manual transmissions, after all, German manufacturers don’t offer their flagships in manual. For instance, you can get a manual Mercedes Benz A class, but you can’t get a Mercedes Benz S class in manual. But unlike American and Chinese customers, Germans don’t consider automatic too high on their priorities list, they are willing to spend the money on certain other options before selecting automatic, but the fundamental phenomenon is still the same. Germans don’t prefer manual when they are willing to spend money, as Germans who buy expensive cars overwhelmingly choose automatic. In fact, I’m willing to take it one step further, Germans don’t like manual, they just dislike it a little less than Americans and Chinese drivers do.
I’m going to extrapolate a little bit from these two key markets and say that, to the majority of consumers worldwide, automatic is the preferred transmission. After all, good modern automatics are faster and/or get better fuel economy. The only difference is how willing consumers are to spend money on the automatic option (and how much money they have to spend in General). North American car buyers are simply more willing to spend money on the automatic (and on so many North American model cars, auto is a no-cost option). 
In fact weirdly enough, the data suggests that American enthusiasts might be the largest group of people who prefer manual out there. After all, the highest end American performance cars are all available with manual (Hellcat Challenger, Shelby Mustang, Corvette), but the same cannot be said about German (AMG GT, Audi R8, TTRS, hell, any AMG) or Japanese (Nissan GTR, Lexus LC, Lexus LFA) performance cars. Of the four German brands that make performance cars (Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Porsche, and Audi), two of them (BMW, Porsche) claim that it was American demand that allowed them to sustain manual transmission development. Hell, Chinese enthusiasts don't care for manual at all! Even the Miata is automatic only in China. 
So in conclusion, the data suggests that US consumers aren’t the only ones who dislike manual transmission, consumers China, Germany, and likely other markets probably don’t like manual either. In fact, US enthusiasts are probably the ones that you should thank for the continual existence of the manual transmission performance car. 
**TLDR:** American customers aren't unique in preferring automatic over manual, they're just the ones most willing/able to pay for it. But American enthusiasts may very well be unique in their overwhelming preference for manual transmission. ",2
"Eulogy for A PT Cruiser
I am no longer one of the few, the not-so-proud, the PT owners. Like many of us, I inherited my PT from a grandmother who stopped driving before I turned 16. It was my dream car - by which I mean it was free and it mostly worked. We were together for more than 10 years. My 2002 Black PT is 14 now. At 90,000+ miles he's had his share of health problems and no one really carries parts for him anymore. He eats all my CDs and his clock runs so fast I stopped reprogramming it. The heating started to go this winter. It started to feel like every drive was rolling the dice as to whether he'd break down. It was time to let him go.
They towed him away this morning. I know PTs are shitty cars and they look stupid as hell. But he was MY shitty stupid car. And I could always find him in the parking lot. ",2
"Does anyone else here share my love of rare but undesirable cars?
During my routine Craigslist classified wanderings I happened upon this crusty but soothingly simplistic relic from 1980's America; [A 1984 Celebrity Eurosport CL 2 door](http://imgur.com/a/vksyd). Try to imagine this pig sporting white-lettered tires cruising down the interstate with a Bruce Springsteen cassette blaring and your mullet flowing in the breeze. Good times, huh? And then in typical GM A-body fashion, it would break down, probably before track #4.

The world had never seen a vehicle with such [class leading styling] (http://imgur.com/kwsNasS), nimble driving dynamics, quality and longevity... Oh, wait, nope, they were steaming piles shit. But they sold like hotcakes and are deservedly ingrained in history as some of the most iconic vehicles of the great American 1980's. Iconic in an ironic way; crap cars like these caused Japanese vehicle sales to skyrocket. 
The Celeb in question is a pretty-darn-close-to-fully-loaded example. The original owner paid extra for the 2.8 V6, 3 speed automatic, the Eurosport pacakge and the CL package.

"I would suggest driving with some sort of dash cam to avoid ending up like me...
**TL;DR If I had a dash cam I would have physical proof someone rolled backwards into me instead of me rolling into them! Now I have a ticket that I need to appeal in court...**
Long post incoming... I'm still confused and upset so I'll just write what's on my mind.
So to start things out I drive a 2004 SVT Ford Focus (my baby), I am a male from Atlanta Georgia who just turned 19 (just in case you are wondering). Anyways,  there is a big hill on my way home from work and since my car is manual its a little tough to go up in bumper to bumper traffic (especially since I just replaced the clutch a couple months ago). I usually try to take the hill slowly so I don't put a lot of stress on the transmission, today I made it up half of the hill before I had to fully stop. As I slowed down to a  complete stop the car in front of me (Nissan Pathfinder, twice the weight of my car) was starting to roll backwards. So I honked my horn to alert the driver, since this was happening from a complete stop the pathfinder wasn't going super fast so I had enough time to ease of the brake to cushion the impact by making my car roll back a little (it was in neutral. not in gear). Our cars collided and there was a small jolt I put the parking break and my hazards on and then the lady in the Pathfinder got out and started yelling at me! She said she was driving a ""dealership vehicle"" (like it gave her some privilege) and blamed me for the accident saying I ran into her! I told her that she was at fault because she rolled backwards into me but she was persistent on blaming me. I had to convince her to pull off at a nearby parking lot (we were in the middle of a 2 lane road in heavy traffic so we were in danger and making traffic worse). I had her take a picture of my license plate so if I were to ""run off"" she could find me (even though I wouldn't when I'm innocent). Once we pulled into a parking lot I started taking pictures of my car and her car and would've taken one of her license plate but she didn't have one (weird). She said she had tried to call the police for 5 minutes but they didn't answer (weird) (since when does 911 not answer!?!?) So we both examined our cars and we realized there was no damage to either vehicle (I maybe had a small scratch). She said since there is no damage or injuries we could just go our separate ways. She did apologize about overreacting (probably because of no damage). That sounded like a good idea but since she was the one at fault and refused to believe it (I don't know if she did it on purpose for insurance fraud or it was an accident). I decided to call my dad before we made a decision and after I told him the story he said I should call the police because she has no license plate which is strange. I decided to call them based on 3 main points
1. I don't want to have her make injury claims or some bullshit because I left without a police report being filed to prove it
2. There was no license plate which is very strange so I wanted to make sure it was her car and something illegal wasn't happening behind the scenes
3. I wanted to make sure there wasn't some sort of intentional insurance fraud going on because I know for a fact that she ran into me and it should be obvious to her
I call the police and they say they will send someone over so I go to wait, (I look like shit because I just got off work and I work for a house contractor so I was sanding drywall all day) she didn't seem upset that I called the cops but after a while she got impatient and took her two kids into the shade. We waited about 45 minutes for the cop to show up and once he did she went straight to him and told him ""her story"" (me running into her). The officer inspects our cars to see if there is any damage. I then approach the officer and tell him my side of the story and he looks at me before I even finish and says ""I don't believe you."" (what the hell! I didn't even get to fully explain anything he just assumed that I'm a stupid kid who ran into an innocent mom) I then tried again and he said ""look no offense but I don't believe your story."" It's like as soon as he saw her car was automatic he assumed it was impossible for it to roll backwards when anyone can put it into neutral (I think you don't even have to push the button on the gear shift for it move to the neutral position). So he then asked the lady if she wanted to file a police report and she said yes (revenge for making her wait and not taking the offer???). So he gets our drivers license and insurance numbers makes the calls and usual ticket stuff. Then he notices no license plate on her car. Basically a dealership is ""lending"" her a car because she doesn't know if she wants to buy it or not. So they go and pull out some ""nice never been driven car"" to make you want to buy it. I'm not really sure why there is no identification on the license plate spot but the officer verified that she had borrowed it so she drives off freely leaving me there alone. He then hands me a ticket for following to close gets me to sign it and says I can pay it or appear in court to appeal it. He explains the license plate thing then says I'm free to go. So I tell him that she could easily have put it in neutral without having to put it in park or even applying the brakes. Now that he actually listened he says ""that is a very important detail you should tell the judge if you decide to show up."" (really? I tried to tell him this before a report was filed but no.... he didn't believe T_T)
Basically I feel like I fucked myself over because I could have just left when the lady said we could go our separate ways and now I have a ticket for who knows how much (probably $100 or $200). I know for a fact it is impossible to run into her since I'm on a steep hill my manual transmission won't let me go from a stop to a speed that would have made the jolting impact that occurred without seriously revving the engine to keep the car from stalling out. And I know I didn't rev it like that because I was stopped!
So if anyone can give me some advice or help or have anything that could help me on my court date that would be awesome! I'm just really worried I'll have to spend my savings on a ticket and get points of my license when I'm completely innocent :(

"Would you consider an over-engineered but notoriously unreliable vehicle ""well-built?""
I always hear about Italian exotics delivering the best experience for the driver and tons of power from their well-tuned engines, but that they're in the shop *all the time* for various issues and parts have a ridiculous markup because of their branding and obscurity/rarity.
So I ask this...we look upon many 90s-2000s Chrysler/GM vehicles with tremendous negativity, because we consider them ""not built well"" because they fall apart and break down like nothing else. But it seems that most Italian supercars are the same or worse, but we still look upon them with envy.
Is it a branding thing? The fact that everyone as a kid looked upon Ferraris with awe?  Is this whywe ignore the fact that according to our traditional definitions, Ferraris are not built well at all; in fact their build quality is total crap. If it weren't, then maybe they wouldn't be such maintenance nightmares.
An excuse for this is often that they're on the ""cutting edge"" but recently I think Volkswagen has proven that you can build ""cutting edge"" vehicles that are built pretty well...examples being mid-late-2000s Porsche and Lamborghinis improving tremendously on reliability. The fact that DSGs originally designed for Porsches are fitted to GTIs and various Audis without issue, delivering performance and relatively good reliability- I cringe at what it would be like if another company started using Ferrari gearboxes on daily-driver cars...they would probably disintegrate if you look at them wrong.
**TL;DR:** Do we have double-standards for what we consider ""well-built"" for exotics vs. normal cars? Why?",2
"Truck From My Grandfather's Last Leg
Hello /r/cars,
I was raised by my grandparents in a very tiny town in Indiana. My grandfather worked for General Motors for 40 years before retiring. He then moved on to another factory job that closed shortly before 9/11. The first thing he did after being forced into retirement ironically was to buy a 2002 Toyota Tundra 4.7L V8 4WD. This was obviously a bold move from a guy that spent 3/4 of his life building General Motors cars. They way he explained it to me was that at the time Toyota simply had the best ""mid-sized"" truck even better than GM or Ford. I grew up in this truck. He'd let me sit in his lap and steer while he operated the pedals. Eventually he let me drive it down empty dirt roads in our tiny town.
Unfortunately in 2010 (when I was 15) I found my grandfather who died unexpectedly in our home while my grandmother and I were at church. It was always his wish that the truck be given to me if I got my license and did well in high school. I worked my butt off to pass my drivers test and get good grades so I could have that truck.
15 years since my grandfather bought the truck, it's got 225,000 miles on it. I've changed the oil every 3,000 miles, put new tires on it (with a loan from my grandma) and the only major issue I had was the ignition cylinder went out and had to be replaced. That was until recently. About a month ago I got new brakes on the truck and started hearing a grinding noise (similar to a wheel bearing) I took my truck to 2 trustworthy shops and they tell me it's the rear differential and a used one will run $1,100 plus $300 to install. Unfortunately, I'm a college student that barely makes enough money to get by and I'm afraid I'm going to have to buy a new car (I WILL NEVER GET RID OF THIS TRUCK) or be forced to  fork out $1500 which I certainly don't have. I'm so torn. I'm afraid replacing the rear end will be a temporary fix until something else breaks. I'm so afraid of hurting this truck that my grandfather gave to me and I don't know what to do.
Will try to post a pic soon.",2
"Every car I've driven- Ranked
All of the cars I've driven, arbitrarily ranked best to worst. 
1 Original beetle:  This was SCARY.  Everything felt thin: the gearshift lever, the steering wheel rim, the chassis.  It was like being in a tin box.  The shift throws seemed meters long.  The vibrations and total inability to accelerate up to traffic speeds made it thrilling to drive.  If you took a golf cart, made it go 55, and stuck a large cardboard box over it, you'd have an original beetle.  I love golf carts.  First place!  I do not recommend.  
2 E46 M3: My dad's car.  Very purpose-built feeling.  Brilliant when driving anything above 30mph.  The engine is fantastic, not violently strong but very linear.  The heavy steering is the best I've felt, and has ruined other cars for me.  The whole car seems to complain when going slow, however.  The clutch is heavy, and the car won't every let you relax when driving in traffic.  
3 Mini Cooper S, 2nd gen:  If these were cheaper to maintain I'd have dumped all my savings into buying one.  Even though it's an ecobox, you sit low to the ground, and the petals are actually in front of you. The clutch travel was approximately 3/8th of an inch.  Super fun, and feels sharp.  I drove it on a bunch of rural gravel roads, and despite being so much slower it was nearly as much fun as my dad's M3.
4 2015 Chevy Suburban:  Drove this cross country.  Sofa on wheels.  I approve. 
5: 2014 Subaru Forester: Drove this on a road trip, and really liked it.  It felt bolted to the road.  It's slow, but the very over-eager throttle petal tries to make up for that.  Visibility was fantastic. I usually don't like crossovers, and this one was ugly both inside and out, but for whenever reason, I enjoyed it, so it gets #5.
6 Miata NA:  Drove in the rain, highly recommend.  I used to bash Miatas.  I don't anymore.  In the Miata, I was getting the back end loose slightly at under 30.  Losing grip felt like it was happening in slow motion, and the car just felt very slow and friendly to drive.  It didn't feel angry like many sports cars feel.  I'm not a fan of gearbox, when shifting it seemed tiny and delicate.
7 Infinity G35 Coupe:  I drove a beat up auto one.  The one thing I can say is that it felt significantly faster than I was expecting.  Steering , handling and ride seems to be fine, but not crisp.  The acceleration really impressed me, but nothing else stood out as great.  Maybe I'm just spoiled by the M, or maybe it's purposely softened for the luxury car audience.  I should drive one of the Z cars, that same acceleration in a more purposeful package would probably be really good.    
8 E46 328i: I drove two.  The first was falling into pieces.  There was a different noise coming from every corner.  The gear shift was possessed and was violently crashing about trying to escape the car.  There was about 2 inches of play in the steering and I hated it.  The second was not falling apart, and that one felt great.  Not fast, drove well, and without every linkage worn away the steering was very good.  When I'm out of college I might try to buy an E46 335, because a middle ground between the M3 and this 328i would make for a great car.
9 Focus ST:  I got my hopes up too much, and was let down.  I read a bunch of reviews, and came in with the promise that ""it doesn't feel like a front wheel drive car.""  I went in with impossible expectations.  It's aggressively front wheel drive.  It does the opposite of hiding it. The (very impressive) power means it torque steers, and the communicative steering means you can feel the front wheels find grip and pull you around a corner.  I'm glad they didn't hid that from the driver, it's good to feel what the car is doing, and the steering is great.  I just expected it to feel different from other FWD cars I've driven, but it felt exactly like them just more pronounced.  I did really like the interior, though.  You feel cocooned, and it's high quality.  Also I liked the planted ride, it didn't feel harsh but was completely connected to the ground. 
10 fiat 500 Abarth manual:  The mini cooper S was better in every single way, except exhaust note.  I could touch the right passenger window without moving from my seat, and the seating position made it feel like I was pushing the pedals down, not forward.  I love the look, and the heavy steering actually makes it drive like a much bigger car.  Unfortunately the exhaust note couldn't make up for a gearbox and seating position that didn't feel sporty at all.  I didn't like it, but if I lived in a city where the narrow, tall shape was useful instead of disconcerting, I could see myself in one.
11 Civic, 1999 and 2010:  I'm lumping these together, they are both equally average.  My friend has a 1999, and I've driven the other in a defensive driving course at the Honda Motor Speedway.  Both drove better than my cobalt, but that might not be a super high bar.  
12 328d xDrive Sports Wagon: My mom's car.  Why is this bellow the Honda Civic?  Because it costs twice as much, and isn't twice as good.  The suspension (or maybe it's the run flats) is crashy, yet it doesn't feel stiff and locked to the road.  Also, it sounds like a tractor.  They did their best to hide it, but don't think you're not giving anything up in exchange for the fuel economy.  My dad once described the steering as ""like driving on a thick layer of caramel,"" and that's not a good thing.  The redeeming qualities are that we really do get 43 mpg out of it, and that the M sport seats are the best seats I've ever sat in.  
13 Chevy Cobalt: my car.  I have a cheap GM car that is 10 years old, has 120 miles on it, and has had NO reliability issues!  It's dull, but has exceeded my expectations.  Also it is surprisingly comfortable on long drives for a small cheap car.  The front suspension creaks and groans whenever it's cold outside, but other than that it's solid.  A side note: my car was recalled for the ignition switch thing, and I did actually try it out to see if I could replicate it.  I could.  Slight pressure on the key and everything would die, including power breaks and steering.  The key also had a slit in it where you'd attach the key fob, so any heavy objects hanging on it would slide down the the side of the key, creating a twisting force.  Replacement key has that slit replaced with a hole, and I can see why.    
14 2005 Lexus is 300: drove slow, caused disappointment.  I'd love a 3-series alternative that would cost less to maintain, and thought this was it.  I had no idea the 0-60 is about 7 and a half seconds, but it is, and it feels like it.  The clutch grabbed way too high, and nothing about the handling was super sporty compared to the 3 series I had driven.  Really cool gauges.
15:  2006 CRV:  My brothers car.  Grabby breaks, feels tall, carries a lot of stuff.  Not at all fun to drive on the highway, much nicer to drive at lower speeds.  
16: 2015 Subaru Legacy: eye-wateringly boring to drive.  Smells like cheap plastic.  
17 Scion xB, second gen: my grandma's car.  She bought this car because it had handles above the rear door to help people get in and out (which I'm fairly sure almost all cars have..)  Those handles may be the car's best feature.  Hers is grey inside and out, which doesn't really help with the young, youthful thing that Toyota was going for.  I really like the 1st gen xB, and hope that it drives nothing like this Second gen. 
18 Nissan Juke NISMO RS: The worst car I've driven.  I like weird cars, and I enjoy the Juke's space toad look.  I'm a young guy.  I live where AWD is useful.  I am exactly Nissan's market.  But after a 20 minute test drive, I ended up with an irrational hatred for the Juke.  CVT's are known for having an odd non-linear feeling.  Turbos are also known for the same.  The two put together in the same car created a complete disconnect between my foot, the rpms, and the speed.  It had the same not-ideal seating position as the crv, with none of the room.  The ride was a bit harsh, but it lacked the locked-to-the road feeling that the stiff Focus ST suspension gave.  
So this is the list so far.  I'm only 20, so it is short.  I'll be working in Warren for GM this summer, so hopefully will have an opportunity to drive some more modern performance cars.  Me and my dad also have plans to go to our Carmax and drive a Fiesta ST and BRZ when either show up in the inventory, should be fun.  
Anyone own these cars and want to comment?  Also suggestions for what cars I might enjoy driving based on these impressions would be welcome.  ",2

"the dot laws of iceland
written and formatted on a computer, i just suck
if you have any questions about the things said here please ask in the comments and i shall try to answer them as best as i can :)
**long post**
so here in Iceland we have a dot system that we use to keep track of anyone that breaks the law driving and to keep track of the ones who often do so, now i do not know how other countries keep track of this or if they even do, but i am going to explain our system
when you get your drivers license you start off with a temporary license that permits you to drive for three years until you have to renew it. this is not the license that most people have as if you drive for one year without getting any dots in your license you can get a full license that lasts for 15 years until you have to renew it. if you do break any laws while having a temporary license you have to wait a full year from getting the dot until you can try and get a full license
when you first get your license you start off with no dots and the only way you get dos on your license is if you brake the law, and the number of dots vary on the degree of the crime you commit
the law than states that if you get a total of 12 dots in 3 years, you lose your drivers license for 3 months
any dots you get dissapear in 3 years
if you have a temporary license you can get up to 3 dots without losing your license but if you get 4 dots your driving license gets taken away indefinitely. you can not get a temporary license again unless you complete a special course and complete the driving test again.  
if you than get a total of 7 dots you lose your temporary license it gets taken away and you can not get the full license until atleast 1 year has passed since your most recent dot was given to you
now comes the list of varying degrees of breaking the law and the dots it gets you, keep in mind that they all vary in the fine you have to also pay if you break it (please ask in the comments if you want more info on the price you have to pay if the law is broken) 
if you break the following laws you get 3 dots and a fine
* driving 26 km/h faster or more than the speed limit (30-35 kmh limit)  
* driving 36 km/h faster or more than the speed limit (50-60 kmh limit)
* driving 41 km/h faster or more than the speed limit (70-90 kmh limit)
if you break the following laws you get 2 dots and a fine
* driving 20-25 km/h faster than the speed limit (30-35 kmh limit)  
* driving 31-35 km/h faster than the speed limit (50-60 kmh limit)
* driving 31-40 km/h faster than the speed limit (70-90 kmh limit)
* driver does **not** stop and help another driver/person in need 
* running a red light
* overtaking right before or on a zebra crossing
* the right of way of a pedestrian ignored on a zebra crossing
* driver ignores or disobeys police instructions
* driver does **not** contact police about an accident that occurs
* driver ignores stopping duty ^((not stopping and giving way for a ambulance/police car/fire truck)^)
* driver ignores the right of way rule
* driver does not adjust speed according to driving conditions ^((for example driving 90 km/h in a blizzard)^)
* driving without a drivers license for the second time ^((meaning the police already cought you once driving without a license and catches you again)^)
if you break the following laws you get 1 dot and a fine
* driving 16-20 km/h faster than the speed limit (30-35 kmh limit)  
* driving 26-30 km/h faster than the speed limit (50-70 kmh limit)
* driving 21-30 km/h faster than the speed limit (80-90 kmh limit)
* driving without a license for the first time and getting cought
* driving the wrong way on a one way road
* overtaking ban ignored
* driving on the sidewalk
* reversing a car or turning around in a way that endangers others
* ignoring the the right of way of a bus coming from a bus stop
* not being careful around a stopped schoolbus
* not giving enough way or slowing down for a ambulance and exetera
* overtaking on the right on two or more lane road
* overtaking a vehicle that is going to the left/signaling going to the right
* not being careful when overtaking
* blocking or not giving enough way for an overtaking driver
* overtaking on or around a intersection
* overtaking when the road ahead has bad visability or is not visable
* ignoring a [waiting sign](http://www.vopnafjardarhreppur.is/asset/5191/IMG_4098.JPG) (cant remeber the proper term)
* headlights turned off when they should be on
* seatbelts not used
* special kidseat not used and safety measures not taken for a child
* people under 15 years old not using safety equipment (seatbelts exetera)
* using a phone while driving (bluetooth and handsfree equipment are allowed if you are making a call)

Started talking cars with my dad when I brought up the fact that rotaries never got any love here in the States.  His only reply was that it was because of ""that fuckin' commercial from the Seventies.""

"Manual Transmission - Lots of Conflicting Information
After taking lessons from a local driving school instructor who insisted on riding the clutch and watching countless videos, only one thing is constant - no one seems to drives stick 100% correct (if that even is possible). Even the link on the sidebar has some conflicting information. 
Anyway, after buying a Manual transmission car, I want to get clarification as what's the best way (in regards to safety & minimizing maintenance costs) to perform some of the basic actions:
* What's the best way to slow down (flat road) - putting it in neutral and using breaks, or downshifting /w rev matching?
* Should you rest your left heel on the floor and just angle your foot on the clutch or should you lift your foot entirely and use your knee to press/depress
* Is it better to accelerate slightly prior to getting the clutch to bite or should you wait until you feel the clutch bite then start accelerating?",2
"Hypothetical cannon ball run discussion, are the big German cars the best idea?
Recently a buddy of mine fell down the VINwiki rabbit hole and discovered Ed Bolian’s record and Alex Roy’s previous record and it sparked the conversation and hypothetical planning on how to beat 28:50.  
Ed did his run in an CL55 AMG and Alex ran his in an M5.  
In our discussion we set a reasonable budget for the run at $55,000 all in for car, countermeasures, modifying and fuel. 
The specs we came up with are: comfortable at 140+ for extended lengths, 16+mpg at speed, 80 gallons of gas for a range of 1280. Meaning 2 full fuel stops and a partial fill as opposed to Ed’s 6. 
After a quick look on eBay I went with an 04 Bentley Arnage R. ($33,000). Top speed of 179mph, highway mileage of 18 (16 realistically), plenty of trunk space for additional fuel. Reasonable amount left over for prep and maintenance before the run.  
He went with a 08 750LI for similar reasons. 
What would your choice be if you were going to try to break 28:50?",2
"Should I take a loss on my new-used nightmare car (2008 Saturn Astra XE), in order to get something that doesn't break down every week?
So, about a month ago, I purchased a used 2008 Saturn Astra XE from a dealer in a nearby city.  It drove well, was in decent condition, and it only had 68,000 miles on it.  I bought the car for about $4800 bucks, putting $500 down and financing the rest for about $150 /m over a 32 month term.
Here is a brief record of what followed:
-A couple of days after bringing it home, A/C started rattling.  Was told that the Compressor was going out and needed replacing, but everything ells looked fine.  Dealer agreed to fix it, despite me not buying the warranty, for about $200 bucks.  I was without the car for about 5 days.
-A week after getting the car back, the radiator blew-out.  My buddy told me it looked like the dealership had nicked it in repairs, but I have no way of proving this.  I called the dealer, they told me they would get back to me, and never did.  Luckily, though i was told the repair would be up and around $800 to do, we were able to pull some strings and get the part replaced fairly cheaply (about $150-200 bucks).
-A week later, i start to hear a whine from the front of the car.  I took it in to the mechanic AGAIN, thinking they would just need to add a little power steering fluid.  I was told that the fluid levels were fine, and that the power steering was, of course, going bad.  Unfortunately, they said that with my model car they would have to replace the whole rack, which would be another very expensive repair.
-At this point, just when I think nothing ells can go wrong, I start to hear a ratting noise coming from under my car while I'm driving down the road.  Haven't gotten it diagnosed yet.
So, after needing 3 pricy repairs in 3 weeks of buying the car, I call the dealer back and tell them about the trouble i've been having with the car.  Lemon law in Alabama doesn't protect used car sales, but I figured it was at least worth a shot.  They told me that would be willing to trade in the vehicle for a similar one, but that I would have to appraise the vehicle to find out what it's worth first.
I know if I trade this car in, I will be taking a loss.  The one they are trying to pitch me on is a low mileage 06 Ford Focus hatchback  which, although I would actually love to have (a Focus was one of the cars i was looking or before settling for the Astra), is about 2 grand more expensive then the car I bought.  At this point, though, I'm not sure what ells to do.  I can't help but feel that if I hold on to this Saturn, I'm going to go into debt trying to afford to replace every single major part of this vehicle.  Should consider trading it back to them?  If so, how much of a loss is acceptable in this kind of situation?  Are there any other alternatives? 
EDIT: Btw, this is the car they want to trade me for http://www.capitolchevrolet.com/used/Ford/2006-Ford-Focus-Montgomery-99c343310a0e0ae7066565359b3b69f6.htm?mycarsr=vdp-recentCars
TL;DR: Bought used car.  Had to make 2 expensive repairs within the first month, and AT LEAST one more is on the way.  Dealer will let me trade my Saturn in for an 06' Ford Focus with low miles, but I will be taking a loss on the car.  Is this loss worth it if I end up with a more reliable vehicle?",2
"Finally got to drive a 6th gen Camaro SS today!
About a month ago I got to drive a 2018 Mustang GT and both Scat Packs back to back. A lot of you seemed to like my mini review of them so here's my thoughts on the Camaro.
I've driven the 6th gen SS before but never on an extended drive up to highway speeds. This car is very different from it's Ford and Dodge competitors in both good and bad ways. The car was a 2017 2SS automatic with every available option. Even the sunroof!
The Camaro has the smallest interior of the three. I'm 6'5 215 pounds and I fit fine. I don't think I'd enjoy an eight hour road trip but it wasn't unbearable. Just snug. Even with the sun roof I had enough head room. The seat was all the way down and back though. The windows are small and it was a little intimidating just sitting in the car. Once on the road it wasn't a big deal. I could see fine. For changing lanes I had to fully turn my head around. Where as with the other two cars I didn't have to.
Interior quality wasn't bad. The 2018 Mustang seemed nicer to me. The Dodges about the same. This is just a personal opinion but I find the current buttons, gauges, and font used in all newer GM vehicles to just look and feel cheap. The door felt a little flimsy compared to the other two cars. The ventilated seats were awesome. The best I've ever felt in a car. They actually got cold. My favorite thing about the interior is the steering wheel. It is small and just feels right for this car. The Mustang/Dodge steering wheels seem a little big to me for a sporty car. The seats were comfortable and supportive. Not as comfortable as the Dodge but just as comfortable as the Mustang but with more support.
Now onto the drive. This car feels heavy and solid. The Mustang feels like a luxury coupe in comparison. This thing is a legit sports car. At parking lot speeds the steering is heavy. It continues to be heavy as speed increases. There was even some road feel though the steering. The Camaro has the best steering feel of the three. The car felt so tight and planted the whole drive. I understand why the Alpha chassis is praised so much now. It cornered flat with no body roll. The Brembo breaks were good. I didn't get to slam them on too hard.
This cars biggest downfall is the transmission. GMs 8 speed is leagues below ZFs 8 speed and the new 10 speed. It is laggy, slow to shift, upshifts too quick and is hesitant to downshift when in drive. When using the paddles it's not an instant response but it's not too bad. It honestly feels like any old 6 speed auto with a better gear spread. I would get the manual in this car. I've heard 6th gens with the 6 speed are magnificent.
IMO the LT1 does not sound as good as the 5.0 or 392. This car had the active exhaust. When you start it it lets out a nice bark and then turns into this quiet metallic rattle. The 5.0 with active exhaust and the 392 both sound better at startup and idle IMO. When going between quiet, sport and track the noise level just increased. The exhaust note didn't change like with the Mustang. It honestly sounded like a truck with a really good exhaust to me. Not a bad sound but just not as nice as the other two. If I bought one I would get the regular exhaust and put an aftermarket cat back on it. Where as if I got a Mustang I would get the active exhaust and leave it alone. I've never been a fan of how the LS/LT engines sound with factory exhaust though. Just personal preference.
The LT1 really surprised me. It seemed like an exact middle ground between the 5.0 and 392. The 5.0 is weaker (relatively) in the lower revs and then comes on strong in the upper revs. The 392 is a monster at low revs but after 4,500 seems to run out of steam. The LT1 didn't have the grunt of the 392 or the high end pull of the 5.0 but it was a perfect middle ground. If I had to pick a car to show someone what a dead flat torque curve looked like this would be it. It has the same monstrous pull at all RPMs. In 8th gear at 1,400 rpms on the highway just roll onto the throttle and it shoots up to 70, 80, 90, 100 without downshifting. Punch it at 90 and it rockets forward. Personally I think the 2018 5.0 is a more fun engine because of it's power band. But this is the best choice for overall street driving. 
My opinion of the 6th gen Camaro is it's the best muscle car offered right now, but it has some serious short comings that put it in 3rd place for me.
What I mean is it's by far the best handling of them all. It has the best engine for street driving. It has a great feel on the road. It's a real sports car. I really understand the comparisons to the M4 now. But only if you spend all of your time on a racetrack. 
The cramped interior, poor visibility, bland styling (IMO), and lackluster exhaust note (IMO) make it a car I would not consider buying. But I prioritize different things than some people. Mainly comfort. I think the Camaro is an awesome car, and if I was in the market for a C7 I would save $20,000 and buy a Camaro.
So in closing, it's a badass car. Just not one I'd buy.",2
"Going on car trip. Parents saying car will break.
So I was planning on going on a car trip with my parent's Camry LE 2007 that I use on a regular basis. 
The trip is from the DC area to Atlanta, total round trip would be under 1400 miles I believe. The car has about 130k mileage on it and my father insists it's an old car and that it will break down during the trip. 
Is this true? I'm not looking forward to my car getting towed but at the same time I believe the car is not in that bad of a shape that it will break down on the highway.",2
"Does fancy tech make cars more disposable?
First off I want to stress I'm not a luddite by any means. I have a smartphone,tablet,laptop,gaming PC,ect. I like my consumer electronics as much as the next guy but I'm dubious about their increasing integration into cars.
My daily driver is a 1990 VW Vanagon GL. Its about as bare bones as it gets and if you didn't know any better you'd think it was made in the 70's not the 90's.  The upshot is that apart from some light surface rust,stained upholstery, and non-functional digital clock on the dash, I'm still getting the same experience driving it as the first owner did back in 1990. I'm proud of my van, and because its relatively easy to maintain and improve, I'm happy to spend the time and money to do so.
&#x200B;
On the flip side:
&#x200B;
The company I work for (I'm a security guard) recently bought some new vehicles to be used on patrols.We got a few 2018 Hyundai Tuscons and a Nissan Rogue. I get to drive them occasionally and although they're nice once I got over the fear of breaking something, I seriously doubt they're going to hold their value as well as my van has. Eventually the big tablet built into the dash, the backup camera, the heated seats, the sensor that turns on the headlights automatically when it's dark....its all going to break. Even if you're willing to keep paying the mechanic to keep the car pristine (I'm just assuming this kind of stuff can't be fixed by a novice mechanic at home, correct me if I'm wrong.) the manufacturers are going to stop making replacement parts soon after the newest, latest and greatest models come out. 
Is the 3rd or 4th owner going to be able to take pride in the car when 10 years down the line half or more of the accessories don't work anymore? That just sounds depressing to me, and I'd feel no incentive to take care of a car like that. I'd be thinking about how badly I want something newer and better every time I drove it.
I'm not saying the Tuscon and Rogue are bad cars, and they may be reliable for a long time. But everything wears out and  I think they'll show their age a lot sooner and more severely than older and simpler cars

"Tricks my grandfather taught me about cars...
My grandfather was a hoot!  Born in 1897, he was raised with cars and seemed to know just about everything about them and he taught my brother and I tons o' stuff.  
I miss him.
Here's a list of different things my grandfather taught me about cars (USE AT YOUR OWN RISK):
You can use large pepper flakes, crushed up dried leaves, coffee grounds or a raw egg to seal a leak in a radiator.
You can use an old pair of nylon stockings as an emergency fan belt.
You can put sawdust in a differential to quiet it down and it's harmless.
If you squirt oil around the intake manifold or carb, the car will smoke out the tailpipe (indicating a leaking gasket).
If you have a tire that won't hold air, you can pack it with old rags and blankets and keep rolling at low speeds as a temporary fix.
You can take a slice of a round log, remove the bark, drill holes for the lug nuts, tack a leather strip around the edge and use this wooden wheel to move a car (he said he did this during WWII when tires couldn't be had).
A shot glass of brake fluid in an automatic transmission will stop leaks.
A shot glass of transmission fluid in the hydrolic brakes will stop leaks.
Blocks of wood perched between the axle and frame will stop the car from bottoming out if overloaded.
You can start and run a car on propane.
You can run a car on a 50/50 mix of kerosene and gasoline but the car will smoke like crazy.
You can remove one bad piston from a car and it will run.  Fill the cylinder with a round block of wood to seal it off from the oil pan.  (The car will have a vibration and should only be run at a low engine speed).
If your gas tank has rust that blocks fuel flow, you can put a tee under the outlet, run a long length of copper tubing up to the dash and blow air by mouth into the tank to dislodge the rust.
If a core in a radiator rots through, you can pack a string coated with tar up into the core (in both directions) to stop the leak.  (You open the core tube with needle nose pliers, then use a needle to pack the tar strings into place.)
You can use a cork or bottle cap as a freeze plug.
Extension cords can be used as sparkplug wires.
Nails can be used as cotter pins.
Cutting a hole in the exhaust pipe before the muffler will give you better gas mileage.
A quart of old motor oil to 10 gallons of gasoline will lubricate the intake valves.
2 'sort of dead' 12 volt batteries can be put in series to give 24 volts or you can put them in parallel to increase amperage.
You can use a car battery to recharge 9 volt transistor batteries. Use a VERY fine wire to attach the 9 volt to keep resistance high.
If a car starter or generator doesn't work, tap and rap on it lightly with a hammer to get a better connection inside on the brushes.
If you have a worn spot on the flywheel and the starter won't engage, turn the engine with the bottom pulley a few degrees to bring better teeth on the ring gear into play.
Also, if you turn your car off while it's in gear/drive, the flywheel will stop in random spots and prevent wearing of the ring gear.
Coca-cola poured onto a loose fan belt will stop it from squeeling once it dries.
Soaking rusty nuts and bolts or tools in coca-cola will remove the rust.
A cracked intake manifold, exhaust manifold or engine block can be patched with furnace cement.
If you have a dead battery that won't hold a charge, drain it and fill it with dissolved epsom salt and put it on low charge for 24 hours, then drain, rinse with distilled water, drain and fill with battery acid.  (This removes scale from the lead plates.  If the plates are gone, this won't work.) 
Rain water IS distilled water (he always had a rain barrel that he collected rain in.)
Putting grease on the rim of a wheel will stop slow leaks between the rim and tire (you deflate the tire, break the bead, grease and then inflate).
You can break the bead of a tire by driving a car up onto the tire.  (Put the tire on the ground and carefully drive up onto the rubber with another car... using the weight of the car to break the bead).
Heating lug nuts with a propane torch will help if they're stuck.
Whacking the back of a tire with a 5 pound hammer will help free it from being stuck to a wheel drum.
A small engine oil leak is good in preventing rust under the car.
If the clutch on your car is old and is slipping a bit, put the emergency brake/hold the brakes and 'burn' the clutch a bit to burn away the 'skin' on the clutch material.
If the clutch on the car is stuck to the pressure plate from lack of use, pull the coil wire (so it won't start), put the car in 2nd gear and turn the key to start it.  The car will lurch forward, freeing the stuck clutch.
Engines can be rinsed clean inside with kerosene.  Let the engine cool completely.  Drain the oil, remove the old oil filter and rinse it out with gasoline and let drip dry.  Put the old filter back on, fill the engine with about a gallon of kerosene.  Start the car and let idle for about 10 seconds.  Don't rev the engine.  Drain the kerosene and let drip dry.  Replace the filter and refill with fresh oil.
To flush the water jacket, remove the thermostat.  Now disconnect the top radiator hose at the radiator and put a garden hose into the radiator hose (use the hose clamp to seal up the garden hose to the radiator hose.  If this doesn't work, you can also wrap an old rag around the connection.)  Disconnect the bottom radiator hose.  Now turn on the water.  The water will enter the top of the jacket, flow through the engine and leave at the bottom... the REVERSE flow that water normally goes through the engine.  Starting the engine for a few moments during this operation will clean out the water pump, too.  Once you've finished the flush, then connect the bottom radiator hose and let the water come up through the radiator to back-flush it as well.  (NOTE: if you put a piece of nylons over the bottom radiator hose during the flush, you can catch anything that's coming out for later inspection... same holds true for catching crap coming out of the radiator during ITS flush.)
If a universal joint fails, you can tie the yokes together with rope and move the car at low speeds.
A piece of string tied to the windshield wipers (along with a return spring) and brought into the cab through the driver's window will allow you to work wipers by hand.
Tinfoil behind tail lights makes them brighter.
One strand of copper wire can be used as a fuse.
Kerosene takes bugs off of car paint.
Newspaper cleans car windows better than paper towels.
Take a raw potato and rub a circle inside your windshield and it won't fog there.
Shirt cardboard can be used to make gaskets.
Putting small magnets inside the oilpan, transmisson and differential will grab steel filings.
3 or 4 shots of acetone in 10 gallons of gasoline will keep the gas lines, fuel pump, intake vales and inside the carburetor clean.

"Walmart has been filling up my girlfriends car with conventional oil when it calls for synthetic for over a year. What can we do?
The tech just noticed and switched it back to synthetic after three or four conventional oil changes. I would think this would damage the car but since the engine hasn't actually broken down yet, is there any chance they will cut us a check?
What about if the engine breaks down in a few years, can we go back and make a claim on the grounds that the engine would have run longer if they didn't screw up?",2

Some are really really rare like the pair of Cadillac concepts that are like 22 feet in length, the Ford Vega concept, etc. And some are less rare (comparatively) like Boss Mustangs and Woody wagons. 
My favorite would have to be the original GT40. It's got the shifter on the right side of the driver even though the driver is on the right side of the car... never seen that before. Another cool shifter is the Ford Vega - it's completely inverted from what I can tell.

"Time to haul some family -- 3 Row SUVs review.
Hi Cars,
Wanted a bigger car for my growing family and learned a lot on the way. This is a super competitive segment because every make is wanting to play. Hopefully my experience can help some others out because there really isn't a clear winner here. Even though I'm going to be critical, you really can't go wrong with any new 3 row SUV or I should say Crossover*. It's really just about which flavor you want.
**Must have:** 
* 3Row/Spacious
* AWD
* Leather
* Rear Cam
* No maintenance / Reliable / Safe
------------------------------------------
Reasoning:
Need space for 2 rear facing car seats in the back(with ability for me 6' to sit comfortably upfront) the double stroller(thing just eats space) in the trunk. Road trips, luggage, gear, maybe more people as well, space is good. 
AWD - better in weather, resale, camping? etc
Leather would be easier for cleaning up any random spills or boogers or puke or mud or ..kids are messy :)
Rear cam - besides the obvious reasons, I live in a younger community with tons of kids near by so I always want to know who/what is behind me.
With little kids, I definitely never want to be stranded. I don't really want to spend time taking my car to the shop. This would make me lean toward new. And most SUVs are safe just based on their size alone.
------------------------------------------
**Wanted:**
* Power/Speed
* Off road prowess
* Tech/features
* Panoramic sun roof
* Comfort
* LED accent lights (I don't think it looks like a NEW car without it)
* Cool factor
------------------------------------------
To get everything I MUST HAVE new, MSRP would be close to 40k for a lot of the big players. So I kinda set that as my price tag. However, one of the main points I wanted to talk about in this post was that MSRP isn't too relevant in this segment. As far as MSRP are concerned, brand new, the Pilot and the Highlander should be your only choices, maybe the Santa fe.
**Pilot**
*pros:*
This thing is a beast. It's the fastest one out there, 0-60 in 6ish seconds in an family hauler, hell ya now we're talking. It FEELS more spacious than all of the others. I sat comfortably in the 3rd row. They have a little area you can pull up behind the 3rd row to make it deeper and give you even more space back there. EX-L will get you leather and an 8 inch screen. You can save 1k off of getting Nav because it has android/apple. So you can decide for another 1k for their collision system or 1500 for entertainment set up...or you can just give your kid a tablet and call it a day. LED accent lights on all trims. Elite trim has some cool stuff but eh not much difference between the 9 speed and 6 speed MPG wise. One of the better AWD systems from some reviews I've seen. Seemed to out preform the highlander on a tame off road course.
*cons:*
Looks like a mini van. Like seriously, I hate how it looks. This is what initially threw me off. NOW, after looking at how boring most of these SUVs are... If I got a black pilot with roof rails and running boards ...maybe blacked out the grill, blacked out the rims, blacked out my eyes so I didn't have to look at it.. [It would be acceptable](http://i.imgur.com/BUwvP87.jpg). 
They weren't giving me as much for my trade and these fly off the lot, especially the black ones. So they weren't going to give me much off MSRP either, maybe 3k if I ping pong between dealers. Bland interior, but functional at least.
**Highlander**
*pros:*
All trims come with their collision system. Looks pretty nice actually, but it looked pretty good before their minor refresh too. New more powerful engine for 2017. Good amount of space. Toyota so you know its going to be reliable and it will hold its value better than any other SUV. Stepping up to the SE trim will get you some cooler looking ones and a sportier suspension, however I didn't really notice much. Pretty standard, safe choice overall. 2nd row Captain seats or Bench option is no extra cost.
*cons:*
Won't get much off MSRP 2-3k again / Won't give much for my trade. They know they have high resale value so they get to be a bit stingy. SE trim and up have the accent LEDs but XLE would cover my Must Haves. Not fast, but not slow for the segment. No Android / apple. Even though new engine, performance was better on previous one.
**4Runner**
Still running a 5 speed? This thing is dated in many ways and doesn't give much except for basic features. You do get a big reliable vehicle with awesome off road ability. I love how they look but interior a lot smaller than the Highlander. Couldn't justify putting this in the running...4running.
**Santa Fe**
Seemed like a great value for what it was. Looks decent too. Interior seemed okay, I just didn't like the design personally. Overall, just wasn't feeling it. Didn't drive one. I think the other two edged it out, however I'm betting I could have gotten a better deal on this. And they have the better standard warranty than the others.
**Arcadia**
Redesigned for 2017 - v6 camaro engine in a caddy. This thing breaks the GMC formula a bit. There are deals to be had on this. I could get my must haves and more for maybe 34-35k(Because they had big discounts 9k+ off MSRP). On paper seemed decently quick, but didn't actually test drive. So that's where it would come back into the picture vs the pilot/highlander, since you would get a lot for less money. I really like how it looks too, but in the end I decided I'm don't want to be a guinea pig for basically a brand new SUV right now. But I wouldn't knock anyone who gets one. Seems like a great SUV.
**Atlas**
I actually know some early adapters for the Atlas and have seen it. It looks great in person, interior is nice and crisp, drives well. Didn't want to wait though and again a new vehicle so they may need to work out some kinks. 
**CX-9**
4banger in a 3row SUV? Stop it. Mazda, Subaru, Ford, Volvo pls. You can't tell me you can load up your SUV, which is like their main purpose, and then preform adequately at highway speeds. Maybe you can and I'm just used to some power, but nope not for me. I really wanted to give the CX-9 a chance anyways since it got such a glorious review from car and driver and sits at their #1. But it really is a dumb car. I love mazda, I like what they do. Sure it has a nice interior and all that, and it drives like a smaller SUV and has a sporty feel to it...uhh nope. It drives like a smaller SUV because it is one. The thing has 71 sqft cargo volume. You can't win the sporty drive in 3rowSUVs when you're really smaller than a ford EDGE but you crammed a 3rd row back there. They may as well throw the Nissan rogue in the picture, I think it actually comes with a 3rd row option and has about the same cargo volume, but you can get it for way cheaper. As a side note, Nissan killed it with the Rogue! I'm a sucker for their star wars edition too. Anyways, I think the Mazda looks the awesome interior and exterior, but if you're missing 12ish sq feet, it's like cheating to be in the segment.
**Explorer**
Almost almost pulled the trigger. But the Explorer's bones are OLD. Due for a full redesign in a few years. They gave it a brand new look in 2016 but its still heavy and feels cramped inside but drives big. It's still based on the Taurus / Flex I think. The 4banger and even the 6 banger? Hard pass, they are damn slow cause the thing is so heavy. Now the sport...365hp, now we're talking. Now I got about 8k+ off MSRP and they were doing me good on my trade too. So that made it closer to the Pilot/Highlander price range. Sync 3 is great too, it has android/apple integrated. But, even with 365hp, its only barely faster than the Pilot. Still...faster is faster. Well, what really made me step back is for NEARLY the same price, I could just get a F150 with the new version of the engine. It has tons of interior room and great off road and can tow 10k+.  POWER: 375 hp @ 5000 rpm TORQUE: 470 lb-ft @ 3500 rpm 10 speed auto 0-60 in 5.7sec SHHWAANGGG! Yes please! Just couldn't convince the wife to make this our family hauler haha.
**MDX**
Okay you're going to hate me if you're still with me here. I went USED with a 2014 MDX with advance package. So it literally has every feature known to man. Drives great, fast, sporty, [looks sexy af](http://www.tflcar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/2014-acura-mdx-tail-lights.jpg). Got it in silver. I got it at bout 8k less than a new Pilot which basically has the same engine. Literally love this car, it has everything I need, the space and a ton more features than any of the new cars except the andriod/apple. I know a must have was reliability and no maintenance for me, however I'm lucky enough to live a few houses down from a honda tech. He's awesome and has a lift . So when I factor my unique situation I decided to roll the dice with used. As far as Acura goes, I'll take their reliability and cheap repair costs. -- Didn't get everything I wanted but for my price point, I knew I'd have to miss out on some stuff no matter what I picked.
------------------------------------------
So Used is a different ball game. Looking for a 2014 specifically was tough because that's right when they did their redesign BUT it's also right at the mark that people turn in leases. And from what I've seen, people don't really give a crap about their lease. They do the bare minimum, treat em rough, and then turn in their keys in 3 years. So there were a lot of poorly loved MDXs for sale. The trick here was to drive a new one, then drive some used ones that fit your budget and keep an eye on their carfax. In my area, it seems like they were trying to sell a bunch that they probably got from auction, originally leased in NY/NJ. Crappy roads, crappy traffic, salted roads...Yeah definitely avoided those and didn't even bother looking at them. 
So eventually one came up that hit all my checkboxes. My goal was to come out a little better than KBB dealer suggestion. But then feel like I got a ""deal"" with little extras that wasn't factored into the price. So the one I got had roof rails($400-500 + installation), all weather floor mats($100-200), and brand new tires. Local owner, and they definitely took care of it. Seems like they just traded it in for something nicer. Honestly, if this is actually as good of condition as I believe it to be, I feel I got a steal over all. I think MDXs are great, and the only reason their used value drops as much as it does is because so many people have them. So thanks to supply and demand, I can get away with a premium SUV for a great price. 
All of these SUVs aren't the tough rugged ones from the past, but they will get you to the beach comfortably. Decent family SUVs, you really can't go wrong. If I had a larger budget, the current Tahoe's are pretty bad ass, also they're redesigning the Sequoia and the Expedition 2018, they both seem pretty ridiculous as well. Just more $.$ than I got and my MDX does get over 30mpg on the highway...so there's that too. 
Thanks for sticking with me. Hope this helps someone, even though I know this is generally a younger crowd.

"Purchased a new 2017 Fiat Abarth and wrote a mini review
https://i.imgur.com/TovRiic.jpg
I recently purchased a new car to replace my old 05 Focus ST (which was totaled by a hit and run outside of my house, 2 years ago.  With my credit shot, I had to buy a really crappy car for 4 grand and make payments on it, which ended up improving my credit score to a ""prime rate"" which I ended up selling back to the dealer for 2 grand.  I began shopping around and I had 2 cars in mind, this abarth (which I have a love for) and a newer focus ST or a fiesta ST.    
After going back and forth between both dealers, I decided to go for the abarth (mostly because the dealer wouldn't let me leave this time and they kept offering me incentives).  Granted I really wanted a Focus ST honestly, because this is my ""car"" and I don't plan on trading it anytime in the future, so if it needs to turn into a people carrier I can do that.
**This is also purely a pleasure car since I have a work vehicle**
I ended up paying 24900 for the Abarth, (with cloth sport seats, AC/Heater/Heated Seats, No Sunroof, 17 inch sport wheels instead of the 16 inch.  This is actually 8 Grand off it's MSRP that the dealer was asking which was 32000.  I do know that they do not hold value and like I said above, I'm keeping this car for a while.  I do regret though not getting a moonroof or this https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BiuRXtKyVoE/maxresdefault.jpg   colour though, but am pretty happy with my panda abarth.  
The Pros
* **The Looks** 
This is honestly one of my favourite cars for looks, it really stands out on the roads I feel, I love all the abarth badges everywhere ALTHOUGH I feel like the ones on the steering wheel do not feel premium (it looks like it was screenprinted ontop of a piece of metal and glued on the steering wheel, I would have loved to see a 3d cutout version instead.  It honestly looks special and even if some angles it looks fucking ugly, other angles it looks absolutely gorgeous.  
Also the steering wheel is really premium, it's nice and thick in the hand and wrapped in a really soft leather, the cloth seats are alright, mine came with the black red combo, which looks great too.  I'm not a big fan of the plastic dash although They put some premium leather above the spedometer it just feels sorta out of place.   Also the doors are heavier than previous years, and close a lot better, it's actually one thing I noticed immediately compared to my friends 2013 fiat turbo. 
* **The Sound**
My brother owned a maserati in the past and when I rev this thing up I literally get an orgasm everytime.  There is something magical about this exhaust note.  https://twitter.com/MeowjinBoo/status/933243114742886405  Just hearing it makes it feel like it goes faster than it really does, and once in a while you hear a little backfire (and i'm sure some flames are shooting out of the exhaust when it does it), I get a tremondous joy when I drive this car.  The sound system that comes stock is pretty good (although there is a BEATS option, I can't imagine it being that much better.
* **The Drive**
Alright this is a good and bad thing.  The most annoying thing is when I start the car everytime I have to hit 5 buttons.  I turn on the rear defroster, front defroster, turn off the traction control, turn on the sport mode, turn on the fog lights, turn on the seat warmer.  I JUST WISH THAT IT WOULD REMEMBER MY SETTINGS FROM WHEN I TURNED OFF THE CAR.  Driving this car without the sport mode just feels sorta sluggish and honestly I have no idea why you would do that.  
Even when I ratbag this car I get 8L/100km.  I fill up with Supreme (94 when I can).  I can't imagine the fuel savings but you'd probably get an extra 100km out of a fuel tank with the button turned off, which is a savings of 15 dollars.  Plus it drives so fucking dull, you lose the throatty exhaust notes, the car doesn't throttle as fast, although the shifting isn't as janky so maybe its good for carrying lots of people around who are whiny passengers.  
The car handles great, sometimes you feel like it can't really go around a corner and the car wants to lift off but it grips, and feels great zooming out of traffic, and I love driving it in Downtown as it's super easy to find parking.  The suspension is also lowered and stiffer so expect to the feel the road alot more.
Now there is turbo lag, and most of your power is going to come after the 3k and feels like it flattens out at the 6k range  and when the turbo PSI builds up the exhaust gets really loud, people will really know your hitting it hard.  I don't really think its a problem but one thing that annoys me is that I can't really start the car in second gear, and I can't tell if I'm a bad driver, but sometimes you hit a right turn and in my old ST you could do it Second, but in this you can't 70% of the time, but when you throw it in first it just jumps forward.  Is this an odd complaint?  Am I bad driver?  I'm not sure.
Also odds are this car won't break 20k km after 4 years.  Also the insurance is around 155 a month for full coverage for me from ICBC.
* **Chryslers LED Speedo thing**
It shows you the amount of G's.  Thats fucking awesome.
**The Cons**
* **Obvious Stuff**  
First of all even though you can sit 4, your not going to be super comfortable int he back, granted I've had 4 people in there without a real issue, everyone likes to make stupid remarks about it being a clown car.  You do have a little room in the hatch for some groceries too and the seats do fold down, but again you bought this because its a pleasure car and nothing else.
* **Resale Value**
YOU WILL LOSE LOTS OF MONEY WITH THIS CAR NO MATTER WHAT.  FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND THE POP'S AND THE BASE FIATS ARE NOTORIOUS FOR BEING UNRELIABLE DUE TO EXTREMLY CHEAP PARTS, THE ABARTH/TURBO HAS A DIFFERENT ENGINE, Different fuel pump, different gear box, different everything.  But it probably didn't help the resale, ontop of the fact that in North America people do like their bigger cars.
Also my rear lights are fogging up, and I have to take this to the dealer already for them to deal with it.
* **Driving Position**
Honestly I'm use to it by now, but I have no idea why I can't find a super comfortable driving position.  The pedals are too close together, I can't get the steering wheel on the right angle, and I cant get my seat on the right angle.  I'm also 6""1, 230 pounds with a really wide and muscular frame (although I am a fatty right now) but even at my slimmest, I can't imagine finding a decent driving position.  It might get annoying on a very long drive, although the seat feels lower than my friends turbo, I feel like it's too high still.  
* **The Car Buying Experience**
Man, I am not a fan of the dealerships here in Vancouver.  Infact if I were to buy another car in the future I'd probably go used with saved money/bank loan.  My only other car buying experience is when I purchased an 08 Acura TL and had a no nonsense car buying experience (probably due to the financial crisis at the time) and ended up making 8 grand at the end of my lease.  
Now this dealership, wouldn't let me leave (claiming that if I slept on it I'd lose the financing which honestly wasn't a big deal to me, I didn't really need a car), when they told me the price per payment they included a 1500 dollar extended warranty that was essentially 6 oil changes and tire rotations and a detailing.  I signed it but according to http://www.fcacanada.ca/owners/en/pdf/SVD252E_NV_brochure_LR.PDF  I can actually get it refunded, which I am doing this weekend.
But seriously I calculated the cost, and how in the world is 6 fucking oil changes costing me 250 dollars each?  They also told me if I wanted the ""lifetime"" engine warranty that I would have to go to their dealer to get all my oil changes done.  Also they didn't detail the car properly, left some stickers on the pedals, and the wrap that was on it, still has some residue.  I'm taking it in for a second detailing.   
* **Chryslers weird touch screen ugly thing**
https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DPghHaoVoAA0V8q.jpg:large
Just look at it.  Seriously, it does everything well, but I just think it's so ugly and out of place.  
TL;DR
I LOVE MY UGLY GOOD LOOKING CAR BUT HATE THE DEALER AND HATE THE DRIVING POSITION.  
Also I plan on keeping this car as my pleasure car and intend to keep it in very good condition.  I think it will age very well and it will make people all gitty if they see one 20 years down the road.",2
"Detectives of R/Cars, can anyone help me identify this car?
Hello, long  time lurker here but decided to reach out to reddit and make a post as I am having trouble figuring out the make and model of this car.
According to the landlord who gave me a copy of the video, most of the vehicle break-ins, they have always noticed this person/car. We assume it is someone who lives in the area as well.
Person have been driving around the neighborhood targeting multiple cars around the block, as confirmed when I walked around the neighborhood and noticed another car with windows rolled down & keyhole a bit pried & co-workers who live nearby reported the same. 
Based on the what the landlord has said about the car, I assume that it is the same person responsible of the vehicle break-in that happened to my roommate. twice.

"I sold my Isuzu Rodeo over two years ago and today I found it at a parking lot near my job. Felt so happy to see it still on the road.
The google earth image when it used to be mine. http://imgur.com/sGIC6H2
We got this car and I believe it had about 145-150k not really sure, my sister got it first than after the engine on my first car(01 Impala) blew, I got this car from her. I kept it until 180k+ miles and that thing still ran like a beast. The alternator went out at 170kish miles and it had major frame rust problems specially in the rear, there was even a recall on it. I was a big fan of honda so I found a really nice 09 civic with 70k miles on it and got it. My dad sold the Isuzu. Over two years later and 4 jobs later I found it again. Together at last. I was going to work today and it was raining like crazy, I get there and the way we park at work, all the employees try to park next to each other since it's a bad neighborhood, we have to spots that we use so the one I park at had too many cars and it was raining hard I decided to go to the other one, the I saw an Isuzu parked there and I thought wow that looks the same as the one I used to have I miss, it even has the same fucked up right rear end bumper no way. Holy shit pretty sure that's mine. Went and saw it and it had the ""I am the stig"" sticker still on there I got so happy! I got down and went inside the hair saloon and asked who's 98 Isuzu that was and this lady looked at me and told me it's hers (she probably thought I hit it or something) I told her it used to be mine and we chatted for a bit and I really regret not giving her my number just in case she wanted to sell it down the line. 
She said it was still running good which means it's probably at least at 200k miles by now
I really regret selling it. If I find it again I'm going to give her my number or if I find a low mileage rust free one I'll get it right away. 
I know it looks like a piece of shit to you guys and I'm sure some of you can relate but this is probably my favorite car that I've owned, it was amazing in the snow, it hauled ass when you floored it, it never let me down even when the alternator went out it did it in the parking lot. It started every shitty Cold Michigan winter. It was horrible on gas but I loved the sound of that v6 when I floored, 200hp awesomeness.
I'm at work and on break I'm sure I made a few types. Don't shoot

"2017 Sienna LE Initial Impressions
We bought a new 2017 Sienna LE while still owning a 2002; after /u/Garage_Dragon made his Odyssey post, I thought it might help someone considering a Sienna if I shared my initial impressions.
**TLDR:   We bought a 2017 Sienna LE in November, with the closeout incentives; there have been no surprises.**
We have some planned family trips coming up this year, so we thought it was a good idea to look into a CPO '15 or 16 Sienna to get some warranty coverage & 'peace of mind' rather than worrying about our 2002 making the trip.  
*( Our current plan is to do the timing belt on the 2002 and give it to our oldest kid, but that may change. )*
First dealership we went to pointed out that with the closeout incentives on 2017s, we could get a new LE-level Sienna for the price a lot of dealers were asking for the CPOs in the region.     So.... we test drove a 2017 XLE AWD, and thus began a day of talking to various dealerships and winding up with a new van.
Below are some first impressions in no particular order:
**Exterior Appearance:**
It's a Sienna.     The 2017 models are the last ones before the refresh, so they haven't been affected by the Gratuitously Aggressive Styling that's plagued all the other Toyotas.    We liked the red and silver variants we saw on the lots -- but this 'predawn mica grey' is really sharp, IMHO.
I think it looks more subdued than the Odyssey, which just seems to be trying too hard to Not Be A Minivan... and I cannot stand the Pacifica.
**Interior fit and finish:**
Everything feels solid, and seems well thought out.    The fold-down third row seats are nice, as is the detachable eighth seat for the middle of the 2nd row.  I haven't tried to look into removing the 2nd row seats for hauling stuff yet.... because it's cold, and we still have the 2002 Sienna kicking around for hauling.   
**Sound System:**
The sound system in our LE is quite nice, in my opinion, for the purpose of being a minivan's sound system.   It will win no awards at the LE trim level.   When listening to Sirius XM, it has intermittent audio cutouts of about 1/4 second in duration every 10-15 minutes -- not a dealbreaker for me, as I'll be using USB drives full of MP3s anyways.
**Climate Control:**
The controls took a bit of getting used to --- but now I see the method to the madness, and applaud the design.    There's a subpanel for 2nd row passengers in the headliner just behind the driver's seat; passengers can either use that to control temp, or the driver can force a 'sync' between front/rear temperature settings to override ambitious kids that want to turn the 2nd row into an approximation of the ice planet Hoth, etc.   If you're coming from an older vehicle, just accept that Auto Mode on the climate control knows better than you, and will get the vehicle to your chosen temperature at an appropriate rate.
**Drivability**:
The '17 is very quiet, in my opinion --- my wife describes it as like 'gliding through traffic'.    Our 2006 Highlander feels distinctly more boat-like and awkward to drive.   The throttle response seems a bit sluggish at times to me, but we haven't had it that long, and I'm still used to our other vehicles.
**Trim Level/Extras:**
Our van came with unheated cloth seats/stowable 8th seat that you can affix between the 2nd row seats, along with the all weather mats.   My biggest complaint would be the included sunshades feel cheap -- if I had to guess what the first thing to break in the face of our children will be, it'll be one of the sunshades.   The XLE we test drove at the first dealer felt very nice inside, but not nice enough to justify the price difference.
**Compared to our 2002**:   I can see driving this one into the ground.    We'll get the 2002 fixed up before handing it off to one of our kids, and it'll live a happy life.
Overall --- we're very happy so far.    11/10, would buy again.",2
"Hi /r/cars, I'm new to engines and turbos and stuff, and I'd like to ask some questions.
It's nearly 5 AM, and I just finished watching Fast&Furious 1&2, and the only thing that was running through my mind was, ""THIS IS SO FRIGGEN COOL!"" I'm sorry if that annoys some of you that think the series sucks, but you have to admit, it's pretty cool.
While watching, I basically had no idea what they were talking about regarding the car's composition, or the engine, etc. Lately I've been getting really into cars, thanks to my friend whose dad owns a beautiful supra. 
My dad knows a lot about cars, and lately I've been asking LOTS of questions about what ""these thingies"" do, or what makes the car break down, and stuff like that. I know it sounds stupid, but I think he's starting to get a little annoyed by me, and we all have to start somewhere, right? 
I have many things that I'd like to ask, but my mind is kind of falling apart, since I should really go to sleep. 
What makes a V8 more powerful than a V6? What do the valves do? If that's the case, why are civics made into race/drag cars? Are V4s actually not as slow as they make them out to be? Do they change out the entire engine? Is it maybe because they're small and have a lot of parts and are light? What's up with rotary engines and why they're hard to maintain compared to another engine? 
I feel dumb because I'm just flooding questions, but I'd hope someone make some kind of mechanics handbook or guide, or at least give me the basics of an engine, and what the parts do, and why a certain part is better than another, etc.
I'm really into cars like 300zx, Supra, RX7, 3rd gen camaros, civics, but I probably can't really afford the supras n stuff.
Is a twin turbo model worth the extra money I'd pay on a 300zx for example? Would it be cheaper to install one yourself? What are the differences of a large turbo vs a twin turbo? 
I'd really appreciate it if at least someone would give me some advice on picking a car, or maybe little info on an engine part. Thanks!",2
"How do you get better at driving a manual once you're already experienced?
I've been driving stick for about 4 years now, I sold the first car my parents gave me within about a week ('03 Camry), bought a stick shift Jetta and haven't looked back since. Since then I've owned a 350z and BRZ and have spent considerable time driving them on the road, on the canyons and on track.  I'd like to think that I've gotten pretty good but I'm still far from perfect and there are still parts that I'd like to improve.  
As with any skill, there is an initial learning phase, where you make strides by leaps and bounds while you figure out the basics, but I feel like my skills have hit a plateau at this point.  Sure I can shift smoothly and do all the little tricks that come with experience (clutchless upshifts and downshifts, heel and toe etc.) but my driving is still far from perfect.  
My heel and toe, while pretty good (I practice it constantly during normal road driving) still isn't perfect, I often miss the perfect spot by a couple hundred rpm up or down, which prevents it from being perfectly smooth.  My shifting, while pretty good, isn't as smooth as that of a nice automatic transmission.  While these skills are workable for normal driving, I know that perfecting them will help me tremendously in keeping the car stable during more ""spirited"" driving and will also give me greater control of the car overall. 
The problem is: I don't know if I've formed any bad habits which are preventing me from reaching perfection and I certainly don't know how to break away from my plateau and get better at this point.  
With any other skill, for example golf, the key to improvement is breaking down the entire process into steps and practicing each one with certain exercises which improve your overall level of skill.  What I'm doing now seems like the equivalent of trying to get better at golf by playing 18 holes over and over.  It's hard to focus on individual parts of my driving skill when I have to concentrate on many different things at the same time.  For example, if I'm driving on a track, I have to concentrate on braking zones and threshold braking, heel and toe, taking a good racing line, and driving the limit/car control among other things all at the same time.  This makes it very difficult to concentrate on specific parts of my driving when I'm doing a bunch of different things at the same time.  In golf, if I want to work on my swing, I go to a driving range, break my swing down into individual steps then improve each detail until I get better.  With driving, it's like I can only practice the whole 'swing' (braking, shifting, line, car control) without being able to control the individual aspects.  Has anyone developed 'exercises' or a 'training routine' for getting better at specific aspects of driving that one can practice?  Sure going to a lot of track days or AutoX events or getting an instructor helps tremendously, but I was wondering if there's a better way of improving your fundamentals . ",2
"I know nothing about cars, was I scammed?
I really don't know where to post this, hopefully here is ok.  So I'm pretty sure I was scammed at least a little, but I'd like to know for sure.  So as I'm driving back from my lunch break a guy with his mom(?) and sister in his truck flag me down and tell me my tire is wobbling.  Says his cousin had a similar problem recently and it fell off while on the freeway and he got seriously hurt.  I drive a 2001 Toyota Tundra, so at 12 years old I'd expect it to start having problems eventually even though I haven't had any yet (bought it new).  
Anyway, we pull in to a crowded gas station and he shows me what he's talking about.  He gets in my truck and I watch from outside, the tire was wobbling with him moving just ~5 feet back and forth.  He says he's a mechanic and that he can fix it.  I should have said thanks man but I'm in a hurry and need to get back to work, but I'm not quick on my toes.  
We pull off to the side and he has me turn on the truck.  First I turn the steering wheel all the way left, then right.  While it's turned right he goes and gets a small something, maybe 3"" long, which he later called a ball joint.  Anyway, while I'm turned right, he starts shaking my truck from back to front and has me slam on the brakes.  We do this 2-3 times, then he goes underneath and is done.  He gets in and I watch from outside and everything looks good, no more tire wobbling.
That's when he asks for money to replace the part (the ball joint) that he used.  Says they charge $600 in his shop, but he'll only charge me $450.  Like I said, not quick on my toes.  How stupid am I?",2

"Community used car/old car maintenance thread.
**Please share your advice!**
We see a lot of questions arise around the maintenance of middle aged cars and beyond. Let’s see if we can get the hive mind to contribute our collective wisdom to answer some of these proactively. 
*****************************************
If you didn’t get an owner’s manual with the car, download one or buy one from somewhere (online or dealer). It contains the maintenance schedule as well all the do's and don’ts of operate that particular vehicle.
If you buy a used vehicle and it doesn’t have service records or clear evidence of scheduled maintenance having been done, perform this sooner than later. Especially critical are items like timing belts if your car uses one. A broken belt may lead to engine replacement. $$$$
Belts and hoses to say nothing of other rubber items, will “age out” and become unreliable at around 7 or 8 years. So even if your car is under mileage, it may still be time to change them. This gives you a chance to look for leaks and catch them before they strand you at the mercy of a strange mechanic.
Tires with visible cracks in the sidewalls are done and should be replaced. Sidewalls heat up as they flex while you drive, and compromised sidewalls can lead to blowouts. Check pressures every week or two. It’s normal for tires to lose up to one PSI every month just sitting around.
Fluids in cars also age due to various chemical reactions. Brake fluid more than 2 years old will increase braking distance and possibly corrode the braking system from within. Coolant turns acidic after 3 or 4 years on average, which leads to internal corrosion as well. Short trips are hard on engine oil as it doesn’t get hot enough to burn off contaminates. Automatic transmission fluid will build up varnish on the internals that may eventually break off and block critical parts of the transmission.
Suspesnions tend to start showing wear around 80K miles or so. Inspect ball joints, rubber bushings, shock mounts, look for leaking shocks, steering boots, drive shaft boots, etc. 
A lot of people are clueless about brakes. You have only to visit /r/justrolledintotheshop to see the amount of neglect people heap on their brakes. Don’t be that person. Inspect them every 25 to 30K miles. Staying ahead on maintenance is always cheaper than dealing with the aftermath of neglect.
The charging system may start to become suspect around 100K or a bit later. Batteries eventually die, as do alternators. Cold climates doubly so. Turn off all electrical accessories before turning off the car, and don’t use the “coming home” function where headlights stay on after the car has been turned off, unless necessary. That tends to prolong the life.
Your a/c system also helps demist the windows in rain or Winter. Inside this system is a lubricating oil that helps keep seals and mechanical components working properly. Be sure to cycle it for 10 minutes or so every couple of weeks even if you don’t need it.
If your car sees a lot of idling and/or it may have had a neglectful prior owner, there may be substantial engine depsits inside the cylinders. This may increase the actual compression ratio, which can lead to knocking (knock sensors can only compensate for a limited range). If your car is otherwise up to date on servicing, try some mid-grade or premium gas to see if the pinging goes away. If so, you might wish to use some [Seafoam](http://seafoamsales.com/sea-foam-motor-treatment/) to remove these deposits.
Open your hood and check fluids weekly or so, depending on how much you drive. If you notice a new smell, sound, or see something different, don’t keep driving until the car stops working (unless an emergency of course). It’s much cheaper to fix a problem at the start, than wait until it cascades across many systems. Cooling systems wear out in that hoses leak, coolant tanks leak, radiators leak, thermostats stop opening and closing correctly. You shouldn’t have to add fluid between coolant flushes every 3 or 4 years. Likewise, transmission fluid levels should be constant. Brake system fluid levels ever so gradually get lower as pads wear down, but adding fluid should be a rare event. ",2
"9th Gen Civic Si Radar Detector Hard-wire guide w/ Pictures!
Hello /r/cars,
I just wanted to post a few pictures of my latest project to share with the community.  I figured out a few things on today's project that might help someone in the near future!
Today I finally decided to hard-wire my Valentine One to my 2015 Civic Si and it came out really nice!  Here is a picture of it all completed: http://i.imgur.com/9WjvkaI.jpg
I started by finding the best location for the device, Valentine recommends as high as possible with a clear view of the front and rear of the car.  I might go with the rear view mirror attachment but this will work for now.
The RJ-11 phone cable I used was about 15 feet which left a lot to zip tie at the end.  I think you can get away with 10 feet.  I also highly recommend wiring the entire thing up and giving it a test just to see if it actually turns on!  Common sense I know.. but the cheap-o telephone wire I used from the dollar store didn't power the device on!
The Valentine One comes with a hard-wire kit which made things pretty easy.  I used fuse tap to 'tap' into the fuse box located below the steering wheel and I grounded it to the nearest bolt that worked.  I actually used a continuity meter to find out what would be the best/working ground. 
***Note:  I purchased the fuse tap from a local auto parts store and placed two 5 amp fuses into it.  The guys at the store say one slot is for the fuse you are taking and adding to the fuse tap and the other is the fuse going to your new 'tapped' power line.  I used 5 amp fuses because it doesn't really matter (I think) because the V1 hard-wire kit has an inline 1 amp fuse not too far down the wire.  Someone correct me if I am wrong.  I also had some 5's laying around doing nothing.  (Fuse #43 was actually blank too).
On the V1 hard-wire kit I cut the red cable with what ever they supply it with, twisted the wire nicely, and crimped it onto the fuse tap.  I then secured the exposed wire with electrical tape.
Here is a good shot showing the setup with the fuse box:
http://i.imgur.com/jLEg38T.jpg
After a quick google search I found that fuse #43 would be the best fit... It powers on with the ignition (or two clicks of the starter) and powers off when the engine is off and the door is opened.
I secured the ground wire first then plugged the fuse tap into fuse #43.  Plugged in the V1 and to my surprise.. it worked!
This is a shot of everything cleaned up a bit after I knew it was working:
Now this was the part I thought was going to be tricky however it turned out pretty easy.  The running of the telephone power wire from the windshield to the fuse box.  Also I wanted it to remain 100% or close to 100% invisible as I wanted a super clean look.
Try to find the wire in this picture =): http://imgur.com/pQlwEyc
Anyway the one thing that helped me out here that I did not find on the internet (surprisingly).... was in order to easily hide the wire and not damage the car use a GUITAR PICK.  Its soft, plastic, and slim enough to get that wire in places where you would not be able to reach.
I was some videos of someone saying pull this down with your hand use a flat head screw driver to pop this...and that absolutely made me cringe.  If I damaged my new car I would stare at that imperfection for a very long time... yikes!
Take that guitar pick and slowly and carefully push the wire little by little into the separation between the glass and where the car's roof starts.  Eventually you will get to the side wall.  DO NOT pop this piece (circled in yellow) with a screw driver!!!!!!!!  
http://imgur.com/PZ7aCxb
I found that the guitar pick easily popped the wire into position and to my surprise there is actually a ton of room back there.
Eventually you are going to get to the weather stripping.  The soft touch plastic part that easily peels up and the wire slides right in.  You may have to put a little more pressure on the wire to make sure it does not twist causing a bump in the weather stripping.
There is actually a ton of room behind it if you push the wire back enough.  My only concern here was that it would cause a bump / bulge in the weather stripping and over time cause it to hold that position, should I remove the wire.
This part was rather quickly as I was able to wedge the guitar pick inside and pop the weather stripping just enough to slide my finger down the entire thing and get most of the wire in place very quickly.  I then used the guitar pick to 'fine tune' areas where i thought the wire did not settle right.
In this picture you can see the wire before I tucked it into place.  I was actually going to leave it like this but figured why not give it a shot and see what happens... good thing I tried!
http://i.imgur.com/OAoEjC8.jpg
There was actually a space in my Civic to slip the wire right near the fuse box making it 100% invisible (to my surprise).  In the picture with my driver's side door open it is right above the hood opening latch.  Very convenient! 
I gave it one quick test..just to see if it was still working.  I happen to have the worst luck in the world.  Everything was good to go so all you need to do at this point is clean up the wires.  There was a nice spot to stick the V1 hard-wire thing where it remained unseen as well as tuck the extra wires.  
A few simple zip ties cleaned it up and it fit nicely by the fuse box.
And that's a wrap!  I hope this was informative and helps a fellow redditor out.  Originally I was not going to do this because I was nervous of damaging the plastic on the car at only 3000 miles into my ownership.  A few things to watch out that I noticed however..
1. The cars roof/hardtop makes this cracking type noise if you push on it too hard.  Be SUPER careful as you may permanently damage your vehicle if you press too hard.
2. The soft/flexible weather stripping might deform if you put too much pressure on it.  Just watch out and use that guitar pick!
3. This car has side airbags.  Pushing that wire into where the air bag is *could* set it off.  I read it on the internet but did not actually find any cases of it doing so.  You could disconnect the battery, I'm assuming, and not set it off.  For this install I did not, although I probably should have.
4. Regarding the side air bags.  I am not sure if having that wire in there will impact its performance and functionality.  If this is of any concern to anyone I highly recommend researching that more and opt not to hard-wire your device.
5. Make sure you have a cold drink and some good tunes!  I did not rush (I took frequent breaks).  This may take over an hour. 
6. I kept the guitar pick inside my glove compartment.  If i decide to take the V1 off the windshield and secure it inside the car (in case I goto some sketchy neighborhood lol).  You can easily store the V1 and push the cord into the roof so it is not dangling and in plain sight.  <-- Kind of a give away that you have something expensive inside your car ;P
7. Off-topic however I really like this feature.  I have T-mobile and a Nexus 6.  T-Mo gives me 'music freedom' with Pandora not counting it towards my data.  I am absolutely loving this cars Bluetooth integration.  It connects automatically so all I have to do is drive.  Big upgrade from my previous (2004 Civic LX Coupe)
Vroom!!

"A guide to detailing by a Semi-professional detailer
Here's my guide to detailing and power polishing, ill answer any questions you have and there is no tl;dr because i don't cut no corners when it comes to detailing. 
1. Washing - I recommend the use of wash mitts rather than sponges. reason being is that the face of a sponge it just a bunch of open sockets that will grab dirt and dust. 2 mits is what i use, one for the paint and one for the rims. foam guns are neat and create a layer of foam on your paint that lubricates your mitt to leave the least amount of *swirl marks*. swirl marks are small scratches that show up in rings around a point of light hitting the paint. my favorite bucket carwash concentrate is meguiars gold class, which contains no wax. many car was soaps come with wax in them, these will remove any creme / paste wax you apply otherwise. 
2. clay bar paint cleansing - clay bars are very popular and very effective at removing contamination from your paint. i clay bar my car once every 6 months, but i especially recommend it before a polish/sealant/wax for best results. they can safely remove melted tire rubber from burnouts, tree sap, brake dust, hydraulic fluid, road tar, and embedded dusts. clay barring is the process of using detailing clay with a lubricant on the paint to remove embedded contaminants. spray on the lube, lightly glide clay across paint, dry with a microfiber towel. you really can feel a difference in the smoothness of your paint before and after especially if your car is 3+ years old. 
3. polishing - when i say polish i mean remove scratches / swirl marks / micro marring / towel marks. i don't mean wax. the main product is cutting compound / rubbing compound. imagine it like a liquid sandpaper that smooths the surface. polishing can be done by hand or by machine. polishing by hand on modern clear coats is tough - i recommend you use a machine. there are 2 main types of power polisher, dual-action and rotory. dual action has a head that  has powered orbits and a free-spinning head. dual action polishing is best for starters as it is almost impossible to burn paint. dual action just doesn't create the heat that a rotory does. rotory machines give the best results but create the heat for paint burns. rotory isn't that risky, i've never burned paint in my career yet. a rotory is simply an angle grinder with a speed control and can be found very cheap. i recommend either the porter cable DA, meguars DA (i own one), or any variable speed rotory (i personally use a kawasaki 11apm 6 speed dial). there are 3 main types of pad for polishing: foam, wool, and microfiber. microfiber is for easy removal of wax/polish. foam and wool are for swirl removal / wax application. foam comes in several grade, heavy to light cutting power and different grades of waxing. i prefer the foam pads myself. now for cutting compound. cutting compound is that liquid sandpaper i talked about earlier, it comes in many different grades. i like the meguiars line of cutting compounds, they come on a scale graded 1-10 on how abrasive they are, 10 being the most corrective and 1 being very fine. there is another type of polish that is known as a diminishing polish - it starts off heavy and as you polish it breaks down and gets finer and finer, a one-step product. so now that you have your polisher, pad, and polish, it's time to get down. kneepads are almost a must. a 25ft extension cord is also essential. plug the polisher in, drape the cord over your shoulder apply your pad and squeeze out a circle or an X of product onto the pad. touch the pad down in 3-4 spots on the panel you're doing (eg. a door or fender) place the pad flat on the paint and on the slowest speed turn it on. know imagine the passes you'd make if you were painting the panel and run that same pattern with the polisher, overlapping each pass by 50%. now body lines  and corners are where paint burns can occur. to avoid these with a rotory keep your pad flat down, dont ride up on the corner. slowly work your speed up to where you're comfortable (4-5 on a DA is safe, 3-4 on a rotory is safe but i run mine at a full 6 with my experience). take the time needed to get as much done as will come out then buff the product away with a micro fiber when you're done. now move onto a finer polish or a wax/sealant.
4. wax/sealant - wax is a natural carnuba base that lasts a month while sealants are normally a polymer base and last 6-8 months. waxes give the best gloss/color depth while sealants give best protection and shine. waxes and sealants come in 3 forms that i know of: spray, cream, and paste. sprays are fast but only last 3 or so washes. creams come in squeeze bottles and are second best to pastes which take the most effort but give best results. when applying a creme by machine squeeze an X or an O onto your pad, set speed to 2 or 3 and its just like polishing, 50% overlapping passes like you're painting it. to apply a paste by machine, wear a nitrile glove and remove the block of wax from its container and while holding it in your gloved hand rub it onto your pad. another type of wax/sealant is the cleaner wax. cleaner wax / sealant is simply wax that contains a cutting compound / polish to remove scratches and oxidation while leaving behind a wax for gloss/protection. cleaner waxes are almost an all in one product that when applied by machine can give fantastic one step results. pro tip - waxes can be layered but sealants cannot be layered, and waxes can be layered ontop of a single layer of sealant. to achieve the best results i do 1 layer sealant, and 2 layers carnuba wax with 1 full day inbetween layers. 
5. rims - when it comes to rims its really simply. there are a variety of polishing heads that fit into a cordless drill made specifically for rims and are often foam. pop one of those in your drill and apply the proper chrome polish or cutting compound for factory cleat coat rims and just give 'er. then after you can apply rim wax. these come normally in sprays that you just aerosol onto the rims and wipe off, but my favorite is a cream that your rub in by hand then buff away. 
6. headlights - there are a variety of headlight restoration packs on the market and im just going to cover my favorite one the meguiars heavy duty restoration kit (~40$) and it has 2 grade of sandpaper to wet sand away the oxidation (bonded oxygen to the plastic that causes haze) then a plastic polish for removing the sanding scratches that is to be applied with the yarn ball head for a cordless drill. it also comes with a sealant for afterwards to protect it from happening again. process takes 30 min and i recommend scotch tape on the paint around the headlight. 
7. trim - i find the best thing to regularly apply to exterior black plastic / rubber trim is either your favorite interior dressing or mothers back to black. interior dressing just spray onto a hand foam pad and rub it on anything that's black, rubber, vinyl, plastic, or leather and it should leave either a glossy or matte finish depending on the product you have selected. mothers back to black can reverse fairly sever sun bleaching on black plastic with as little as 3-4 applications. 
8. leather - there are 3 different types of leather product, cleaner conditioner and protectant. they're all pretty self explanitory, and i recommend use of all 3 or often combinations of 2 can be found for example a 2 in 1 cleaner conditioner. only thing here is i recommend you never use cleaner by itself - always follow with conditioner or protectant because some leather cleaners remove lots of moisture from the leather and can kinda shrink it if all you use is a cleaner. 
9. glass - theres 2 types of product i know of. glass cleaners and glass sealants. glass sealants repel water slow and slush for better visability and better cleaning from wipers. glass cleaners come in sprays and creams and holy man, a cream glass cleaner from a squeze bottle leaves glass looking brand new taking off MUCH that spray glass cleaners remove. combination 2 in 1 cleaner / water repelants can be found. 
my routine for achieving the best exterior shine is to wash the car, clay bar it, high speed polish with a heavy cut foam pad and heavy cut polish, then again with the high speed but with a light cut pad and light cut polish, then a layer of sealant (meguiars NXT 2.0 is my favorite) then i'd wait a day or 2 for the sealant to set then i'd apply a layer of carnauba wax ontop. i'll answer any questions you'd like.

"Introducing my 1979 TA. (X-post from r/project cars)
Here's an album of my 1979 Trans Am- it's designated project warmachine because I'm working on assembling a bullet proof street car and bracket racer all wrapped in one. This is the second round on the car- I've had it since I was 15.
1979 Trans Am http://imgur.com/a/3L3kH?desktop=1
463 inch big block chevy- I can give specs if you all are interested, but it's nothing exotic. I built the first motor and this one myself. The first motor was a worn out 396 that had a wrist pin take a stroll with less than 5000 miles on it due to machine shop error, and it wound up getting pulled for this 454.
th400 tranny with some B&M pieces and a shift kit- it was built a while ago and not by me, so I'm not sure what all has been done.
Currently the rear end is an 8.5 inch ten bolt with 3.08s and a posi unit, but I've got a bolt in Moser Dana 60 with a spool and 4.10s ready to go in it, it's just a matter of finding time.
The inside is pretty much all stock, with no power options and aftermarket seats- I've got 75 bucks and 20 hours in the seats, and nothing in the harnesses.
The body and Undercarriage is 100 percent rust free- a true southern car. I did the body work about two years ago when I was 17, and my uncle sprayed the car. I have just recently developed any amount of ability with a paint gun. I painted the cowl and inner fenders and radiator support over my Christmas break.
I do all my own work- nothing gets outsourced to anyone except machine work- I'd say all in all I have around 8500 dollars in it, and when it warms up, I'm expecting it to run consistent low-7 1/8 miles with no rear end swap and no tuning. The 4.10s, a little fiddling and some slicks would drop me down into the sixes most likely.
The current plans are: 1) Get my spoilers fixed and back on it- theat last photo is a show from 10 months ago before I slid it into a ditch.
2) Get my Dana swapped in
3) install my traction bars and frame connectors
4) minor things like firewall plugs.
5) heater core and build a suitcase for under the hood to hold the squirrel cage.
6) wiper motor
7) fix, paint and install my three inch fiberglass cowl hod",2
"Majestic sunset drive with an Alfa Romeo 4C
> https://imgur.com/a/3eWiK <<<<<<
I'm a performance driving instructor on the side and very much enjoy driving different cars and analyzing them. Here's what I think of the 4C after spending a weekend putting it through it's paces on the open roads. 
&nbsp;
The Good:
+ Shockingly exotic sounding 1.7L engine. It makes Group B rally car blow-off noises! Driving around at parking lot speeds the exhaust note is surprisingly deep and bassy. Our car has the factory optional sports exhaust.
+ Steering is sharp and direct, yes, it's a bit heavy below 3mph but once you get up to 5mph it actually gets much much lighter than I expected. Driving this car can be quite tiring, you really have to keep 2 hands on the wheel at all times- there is a fair amount of bump-steer and you do have to fight the wheel on bumpy roads. 
+ The carbon tub. Run over the center line reflectors on a road and get ready to have your fillings shaken loose! The chassis is incredibly stiff and communicative! 
&nbsp;
The Bad:
+ The headunit. It would be nice to see an nice small infotainment system but instead you get what looks like an aftermarket part. Operation of the unit is a little confusing and it has displayed some kind of error on the screen on numerous occasions.
+ Oddly shaped steering wheel - specifically where you put your hands at 9 and 3. This might be one of the most un-ergonomic designs I've felt on a sports car. The palm rest area is strangely bulbous and the back side where your fingers lay doesn't have enough support. There's also a lack of thumb rests, so if you like to keep your thumbs outside the wheel rim to keep them from getting caught up when catching big oversteer, you'll be bummed. Because of the awkward steering wheel shape/lack of support and the need to constantly fight the wheel on bumpy roads hand fatigue is something of an issue. 
+ As most of you know the transmission is....not great. It's absolutely not in the same league as a PDK. More concerning however is that the 1-2 shift is sometimes very, very violent. It almost feels like it may break it's self. Also when you downshift from 2-1 while braking at low speeds it seems like the engine is fighting you while you're trying to slow the car down. A little scary when you're in traffic. You have to press the brakes extra hard when you downshift from 2-1 at low speed basically. 
&nbsp;
The Quirky:
+ Opening the rear hatch to put something inside is a 2 handed operation. The trunk/engine lid won't stay up on it's own, you have to use a silly stand. Also, this thing has 1/4 of the luggage space of a Cayman. 
+ There are a few seemingly ""unfinished"" areas of the interior, if you poke around and look where you normally wouldn't.
+ If you try and grab a lower gear at too high of a rpm the car will beep at you quite loudly instead of simply denying the shift as in most flappy paddle cars. Have fun trying to explain ""that beeping noise"" to your passengers when this happens. ",2
"How far would you travel for a car? I just did 1800 miles, worth it.
You can imagine my surprise when my phone range with an unknown phone number, it was quite limited. For you see; the average unexpected phone call these days usually starts with “you have won a…” or “are you satisfied with your insur….” Most of which end mid sentence, because I couldn’t be bothered to allow the poor soul on the other side to even finish their statement.
This phone call was different, the area code started with “313.”
313 is significant. 313 is the home of wild animals; there are Lions, and Tigers, and Horses. 
Knowing the significance of this area code, I answered. “Hello, this is iamnotcreativeDET.” On the other end I was happily greeted by a cheerful woman from General Motors. Initially I was less than impressed, thinking they wanted me to review their new Tesla, or Audi, or something. Her joyful tone couldn’t break me out of my uninspired haze, they wanted me to try out some dreary new Chevy. 
I was wrong. 
You see, when press cars are given out they sometimes offer options; deliver to a location of your specification, or you can pick your home address, or your office, or they require you travel to a pre-selected location. In this situation; viva Las Vegas. Having never gone I ecstatic, most reviews I find myself doing end up being in my home territory, and usually end up being econoboxes, finally I could submit an expense report for long distance travel, and enjoy some R&R while I was there (shhhh, don’t tell finance). 
After setting meet and great details, I booked my flight and hotel room at Ceasar’s Palace. The car would be waiting for me on the 3rd level of the Self Parking, it was mine from Thursday till Sunday.
This might be a good time to mention that I should start off by saying; I am by all means an introvert. I don’t enjoy being around large groups of people, I tend to be quiet and keep to myself in these situations, nor do I gamble or enjoy high dollar shows, I do, however find driving on a deserted road in the Nevada desert to be extremely exciting, for somewhat obvious reasons… 
I arrived on Thursday morning at 8 am. My uber driver conversed with me on the way to the casino, attempting to excite me about all of the great places to gamble and shows that I could enjoy. These were at the back of my mind, all I could think about was the pedal on the right, and what it would be like to mash it, repeatedly. 
The hotel Concierge had the keys to my car lined up, I hastily dropped my belongings off in my hotel room and rushed to the parking garage to get my first look at the bright red 2016 Camaro SS Convertible that had been so gracefully parked on the 3rd level of the Caesar’s Palace parking garage. 
Powered by an LT1 6.2 Liter V8 and paired to GM’s brand new in house 8 speed automatic transmission, the Camaro SS is the least expensive way to get over 450 horsepower in a drop top production car. I could hardly contain myself, all I wanted to do was find the fastest possible way to piss off a law enforcement official. I could even feel the hair on the back of my head growing faster than on the top. 
I had planned a couple of long road trips, an opportunity to bond with the car, long streaks of highway paired to canyon carving with low and high elevation curvaceous roads. I wanted to know this car before I got on the plane back home. The Camaro and I would spend 700 miles of pure unsupervised fun, how can this be legal?
On my 4 day excursion, I found myself at places like the Hoover dam, The Grand Canyon, and on the further side of the spectrum, Zion National Park. These are all places I highly recommend going to at one point in your life, they are spectacular places, but my boss probably will read this, and I can imagine if I spent a large percentage of my required words being spent talking about how gorgeous Zion National park is in the debt of winter, or how the Hoover dam is made of 4.3 Million cubic yards of concrete, or how it took 17 million years for flowing water to carve out the grand canyon. He might be marginally cross with me. 
So how was it? Deep. I couldn’t believe how far down the Grand Canyon went, it seemed like you could spend a lifetime falling into that hole…. Oh, you wanted to know about the car. Well alright then, I suppose we can talk about that.
The interior felt cheap. On face value everything looked very nice, a true homage to 60s style combined with modern plastic molding and fit and finish. My feelings on the interior went from delighted to massive disappointment quickly, every single surface inside the car is very hard plastic, it is almost as if GM engineers haven’t heard of soft touch plastics and vinyls, these are the things that create and impression of quality, something the Germans and Japanese have figured out decades ago. There was some leather on the arm rest, and door cards, completely out of view. 
Then there was the creeks and rattles. This car had 3 miles on it when I pressed the start button for the very first time, and for the 4 days that I had it I had to smack the plastic liner on the convertible top because it was constantly rattling and tapping away, even on the smoothest of roads. I would understand that out of a car that is 5 or 6 years old, especially in something as flexible as a convertible, but on a sub $46K car, it seems disappointing. Clearly all of the money on this car is spent on the powertrain, roof, and styling. 
The power is savage. If you have anything sitting on the center console it almost definitely will end up wedged under the back seat and lost in another point in time and space. The 455 horsepower LT1 is a welcomed addition to the Camaro, along with GM’s own brand new 8 speed automatic. At full chat the upshifts are lighting fast, a true feat given that it still has a traditional torque converter automatic, when you take the engine to redline and use the paddle shifter with the car in track mode, the exhaust pops and crackles on every upshift. Matting the throttle in 2nd gear sends the back of the car in an all out drift and caused my face physical pain as I grinned ear to ear and laughed like a maniac. 
But its civilized. Putting the car’s computer in touring mode, setting the cruise control, and sitting back in GM’s plush and comfortable cloth seats make the car feel comfortable. Long distances can easily be done, albeit with a bit of wind noise, which is always to be expected from any cloth top convertible. The engine regularly drops down to 4 cylinders at cruising speeds, during which time I found average fuel economy of around 25 miles per gallon, quite impressive given the regular elevation changes of the Nevada and Utah express ways that I traveled on, and the fact that my right foot seemed like it was glued on the carpet. 
The chassis is well sorted, having driven an earlier model coupe Camaro, there is definitely an obvious loss of rigidity by removing the roof, but its far from obtrusive, the 3700 pound drop head Camaro wears its weight quite well, feeling toss-able and lively on tight and technical roads, switching to track mode ads a significant amount of weight to the steering, but doesn’t change the fact that the road feedback is numb, like any other electric power steering system of this era. The trunk, however, is next to useless. It hardly fit my two suitcases for the trip, my jacket had to ride in the back seat.
Simply put, the new Camaro SS is a taste of typical American build quality with a special taste of Corvette V8 paired to a sensible and aggressive 8 speed automatic transmission, it is tons of fun and easily livable as an every day vehicle. 
tl;dr - 2016 Camaro fast, shit pants. ",2
"Let's talk about the smell of cars...
This might be an odd topic, but hear me out. It's said smell has the strongest ability of all the senses to trigger memory. While this may sound like nonsense, I've noticed in my own personal experience that there may be merit to this claim.   
Last night, I was driving my Cayenne and was driving it a little bit spiritedly. When I got out and walked around the rear of the car, I caught the smell of the brake dust, which took me back to my driveway back in 2012. I had just driven home from work through a light rain storm in my Lancer Evolution, recently graduated from university. I had been at my new job for a few months by this point, allowing me to purchase the Evo, and I was filled with enthusiasm for my new career and the possibilities the future held ahead of me. Given my experience of how the rain left behind dust marks all over the paint of my Lancer I started to wash my car, and I vividly remember the smell of the Brembo brakes as I was wiping down the car with my microfiber towel, tending to my attainable dream car.   
Or, there is getting into my Civic Si (the one that was stolen that I shared the story of yesterday) where the moonroof cover has been exposed to rainwater and the elements over time. In the morning, when the air is crisp and the dew is still fresh on the car, the moonroof cover has this particular musty smell to it. Not unpleasant, but noticeable. Every time I get into that Civic now, the smell transports me to a cold morning in the summer of 2016. My friend and I are driving to an autocross event in Colorado Springs, which is about a 100 mile drive. The gate to the track opens at 6:30 am, so we are both groggy, and we're being jostled around by the Civic on stiff suspension and inundated with the drone of the exhaust, but eurobeat is blaring on the radio and we're joking along the way. We stop at a 7-11 off of the highway to top of the fuel tank and to get some energy drinks/coffee. They had these Stok espresso shot cups at the coffee station to add to the coffee, so I added a couple of those to my coffee thinking ""more caffeine is never a bad thing"". But, those things tasted *awful*, much to my friend's amusement as I'm trying to drink this swill and wake up. He is getting to drive Thundermuffin for the first time to get used to it on the way down to the race, and he's thoroughly enjoying himself. The experience of getting to share my car who is enjoying the drive and hanging out gives me that ""warm fuzzy"" feeling.      
Then, there was the time a couple of weeks ago where I was swapping the interior in a different Civic. As I am pulling out the dash, some of the foam sealing material breaks off and hits me in the face. But, the thing about these foams is they develop a very distinct smell as they break down, and as I'm being showered in this foam dust, I am suddenly six years old again. My dad is driving his 1972 Chevy Pickup with the 4 speed transmission through the high plains outside of Steamboat Springs, and it's a warm summer day. My grandfather had just gave it to my dad, and my dad had just spent some time working on it get running again. It always had one issue or another, but he had just installed a crate motor and installed a custom radio. With his radio, though, he used standalone speakers instead of putting speakers into the doors that sat on the bench, made of the same foam material that had just hit me in the face. Any time he hit the brakes too hard, the speaker would move forward and try to fall off the bench, so I would help to keep the speaker in place while he's driving. I'm happy to be along for the ride and hanging out with Dad, and the sound of the V8 thrumming under hood of the pickup is resonating throughout the cabin. I believe it's some of my dad's more interesting vehicles that he's had (that pickup, his late 80s Audi 4000 Quattro with the I5, and his National Crane) that fostered my love for vehicles   
The bout with the Cayenne's brakes last night got me thinking about it, and there are more stories I have, but let's hear your experience. What unique smells does your car have that takes you back to another time?",2
"My 1989 911 and its story... pics inside
copy and pasted from a post of mine from 6 months ago. I'll answer any questions you guys have and I'm apologizing in advance for my wall of text.......  
I've been a car guy since I was like 13 years old, literally every $ I got went straight into a savings account for my dream car. This meant any babysitting money, any Christmas money, anything like that went right into my car fund.... long before I could drive. 
I would spend all of my free time researching what needs to be my first car. (My brothers first car was a 2000 323I which I drive to school everyday now that he's in college and has an 07 Z4 3.0si)
It started with craigslist, id look up a car brand I know and look at cool looking cars, because of course that was my only priority. 
I cared nothing about horsepower or reliability, only that I must find a car around 6000 because that was my brothers budget when he got his first car. 
That's how the jaguar xk8 was my first love. I wanted to put a body kit on it and a huge spoiler.
That lasted about a month. 
Then I fell in love with the Celica, then the eclipse, then Alfa Romeos..
It went on for a few years, debating what needed to be my first car.. countless hours and hours of looking at cars....
Then my brother got that z4... 
So I had it in my mind that when I turn 18 I too will get 25k to spend on a car as a graduation present from my parents, so then I came up with a grand plan, id work for two and a half years and save every cent and buy a lotus elise for 30k. 
This was my dream up until about 4 months ago.
I actually made a post on r/cars well over a year ago saying that I am young and I'm going to save up for a lotus.. and if I went on my old account I could probably dig up that thread.. 
I made an account on lotus talk and I was active there every day for over a year, that's when I started to think, well if my first cars budget Is 6k, maybe with all the money I've saved ill be able to get a nice car for my first.. 
Keep in mind this is a shaky timeline of the last few years of my life.
I slowly turned my dad into a car guy, as I did with my brother, I  was actually the one who suggested the z4, and I was the one that found the one he bought. 
Cue looking at a billion cars... I knew I liked japanese, but HATED the whole body kit/ stance scene. I loved and adored classic European and new European. Porsches, bmws, alfas, mercs, jags... I wanted one like crazy. 
For my first car I wanted something that everyone in my family would love, and I wanted to get something my dad and I could work on together.. he says he let me get a nice car because I've never been into anything as much as I was cars.
I never played sports, I never really had any money spent on things like a travel team or that cool new lax stick..all the momey that would be there id have rather spent  on a car. 
My brother got to go to greece for his senior year, when asked if I want to go when im a senior Ill say hell no! 
If your fling to spend that kind of crazy money on me....  itll be better to get a supercharger kit. 
So anyway back to the car. 
I knew my mind changed practically every week on what car I wanted,  knew id have about 15k to spend from skill my savings plus my parents, so I searched and searched...
It needed power, it need to turn heads, and I wanted it to have prestige.
Well I remember looking up porsches 911s a while back...
Cue looking at 84-89 year models, the 3.2 carrera... nice little package, emailed a few people, didn't really go anywhere. 
I've been 16 for a few months and ive been driving the bmw 323 while looking for my actual car I wanted, spring break was coming up and this has to be my only chance to go travel and get a car and bring it back before summer.
My dad LOVED the idea of an early 911 
I looked on  search tempest every day  for those year model cars in my price range.
Ill never forget, I was in my room on the computer and there was an ad 300 miles away titled
""Lady in red porsche 911""
I hadnt bothered clicking it before in my searches because I assumed it was a new one.
Nope
1989 Porsche 911 Carrera 4
The ad just said ""89 porsche 911 call for details time for this old man to move on. $15,000.""
There were no pics.
""No. Way."" I said
I ran down, my dad called him immediately, this could be an insane deal if  in good shape.
He had the car listed for a while, had  people come and see the car but eventually turned them away because he thought they werent good for the car. 
  Well shit we better make a good impression.  
 He was VERY iffy on us getting a ppi, we could tell he was very old school.  
 We made an appointment, and went to see the car that Friday. 
After a good 3 hour turned down the road... and saw this: http://www.imgur.com/sycpPuT.jpeg  
 Oh hell it's over. I need it. 
  We took a test drive. I wasnt allowed to drive it, it was torture.
   My dad says the gearbox is crisp and the engine was responsive. Good. I said give it some gas..   2 up to 3 thousand rpm felt great, but not fast... not at all compared to the z4 even with similar stats.   
We never took it above 4k. 
  Well the cars not that fast, its raspy and the ac only blows hot air.   
We looked at eachother and smiled and knew we were gonna own it. 
  It had 150,000 miles.   But here's the best part, the p.o. spent over 30k in a brand new engine, new clutch, paintjob.....20k miles ago.   
Ohdearlordyes.jpeg   
We drove home... came back a few days later for the ppi... we drove it 30 minutes away to a porsche dealer. 
  A man took it around the block, jacked it up and showed us the two oil leaks, and told us two warning lights were on, one for brake fluid and one for the 4wd system
Damn this could get pricey..  
 Of course we bought it anyway. 
  Within a week of owner ship we bought a thing of brake fluid and one filed up, we never saw those lights again.
Oh and that whole not faster than the z4 thing was disproved the second I drove the car for the first time...  
 If course 2-3 didn't get us much of anywhere, this sucker starts flyng past 3.5 and up...  
 And good. Lord. Does it fly.  
 Lets just say when I press down at 3k rpm the passengers either burst into laughing or just say..... jwicheisjfbjwjxbd
 I have never taken the porsche to school. I never intend to.
 As of now ive owned the car for 2 and a half months but I could never imagine it gone I go out when im bored and just sit in the drivers seat and browse reddit..  
 I've already waxed her 3 times and wash her every few days.  
 Every morning when I wake up I go straight out side and just look all around it and make sure there's no dirt or anything on her.  
 I've already been in two car shows and I love the car more every day. 
  Honestly its my most prized thing in my life, I am never selling this car. 
  This is probably the billionth time I've posted this next thing but....  
 Obligatory pictures of how it is now:

"Honda $399 3 year Security Plan?
Hey everyone,
So my wife and I went to see a 2013 CRV at a dealership in Toronto on Saturday.  I talked the sales guy down a few thousand dollars from the advertised price, to a point where I felt comfortable I was paying a fair price for the car.  
My problem started when we went to sign the paperwork with the sales manager.  He went through everything with us, seemed like a knowledgeable dude, was understanding when we said we'd be declining any extended warranty coverage and rust proofing etc.
Just as I was about to start signing, I see this $399 'Honda 3 year Security Plan' charge added to the bill.  I asked what it was, and he told me that it was a non-negotiable program that all certified Honda's are enrolled in when they're sold.  It bacically covers my deductible and puts some cash in my pocket ($3500 or so he said) should my car be stolen, since Honda's are notoriously easy to steal.
I told him that I have insurance coverage for that, but he told me that if I didn't enroll the car in the program, that he couldn't sell it to me, as per Honda Canada's regulations.  Apparently it's been policy for a decade or so.
Now, $400 wasn't going to break our bank, and the car is still a pretty good deal for what we're getting, but I'm just curious, has anyone else ever heard of this?  I thought it was pretty shady, waiting until I saw it on the bill of sale and having to ask about it with a pen in my hand ready to sign...
Mostly I'm wondering if this is something they just add to he bill for those customers who really manage to talk the sales guys down to a reasonable price?  Is it legit?
---
EDIT:  Want to sincerely thank you all for the responses.  I'm usually diligent and do my homework on things like this but I got duped this time.  C'est la vie I guess.  I'll know better next time.  Loving the new ride despite this.
Cheers!",2
"I'm convinced that Nokians are made by Finnish wizards. (A tale of the winter adventures of an overcautious Southerner.)
Sorry people who hate the winter tire circlejerk, this isn't for you.  For everyone else, here's my longwinded adventure of icy badness and goodness.  Also, Northerners (and my Euro bros too), feel free to laugh at us Southerners and how much we fuck up.
Scored a sweet deal on a second set of OEM takeoff wheels identical to the wheels on my Colorado for < $400 with TPMS for the whole set a few weeks back.  Called up my local Discount Tire to see what options they could get me.  I was initialy eyeing some Michelin Xi2s because they were relatively cheap and I had good experience with Xi3s on an older Mustang in the past (Xi2s are the newest they make in light truck tires it seems).  Asked him if he could get me either some of those or some Blizzaks.  I had also noticed that I could get some Hakkapeliitta R2 SUVs for a few hundred bucks more, but I was mostly eyeing the Michelins.  Well, neither the Xi2s or Blizzaks were in stock where he could get them quickly in my size.  He was able to get the Nokians though, so I said fuck it, I'll try these out and see if they really live up to the hype.  
I should also point out that I live in the Southeast, so no, they're not really ""needed"", but I'm a tire snob and pretty anal about that stuff, so I wanted them.  So anyway, this morning we got our first snowfall.  Went into work and the roads were mostly clear, no issues.  Went to lunch later on in the day and was able to take completely iced over backroads with no issues and not even a hint of wheelspin.  This was where they first paid for themselves as I was going down the road, a woman trying to stop at a stop sign slid out into the road in front of me, but I was able to easily stop without sliding and she was able to continue on in front of me and hopefully make it where she was going.
Got let out of work a bit early to beat rush hour traffic.  The main roads in the city were mostly clear by this time (snow had stopped and salt was doing its job).  As I got out near my burbs though, the ice sheets returned.  This is where I knew they would get their real test, as the area leading to my neighborhood has two routes into it, both are full of hills and shaded areas that never get salt or plowing quickly.  While I was on a long straight stretch in this area where no cars were around, I also decided to do a braking test, just to see exactly where the limit on these tires was exactly.  I was happy to see that even doing 30ish on ice, I was able to brake quickly with only a little initial sliding, then grip and a very quick stop, all things considered.  
I got to the bottom of the major hill in the area when I realized shit had hit the fan.  Tons of cars off in the ditch.  I wasn't phased though, and at this point I decided welp, time to throw it in 4-high, just in case, and slowly creep up this hill.  Crept up at about 5 MPH, and this is where it got interesting.  Seeing all the cars off the road, I was amazed a bit and broke my rule of no fucking with the phone while driving for a second and quickly fired up the video camera on my S7 to record the chaos (while still paying complete attention to the road of course).  Sorry r/cars, please don't crucify me for that lapse in judgement like my local subreddit did, since trust me, it didn't really affect what followed.  Well, a little ways up the hill I see a black Tahoe coming down the hill and there's not room for both of us.  I toss my phone off into the passenger seat while saying ""oh shit"" and grab the wheel with both hands and hustle into a gap on the side of the road in between a stuck Escape and a stuck Rogue.  Phew, I'm safely out of this dude's way and can just stop here and wait for him to pass.  Well, a few seconds later he passes by, except he's sliding and fishtailing down the hill.  As he passes me, he grazes my backend.  Oh fuck.  After I brief initial shock, I throw the truck in park and hop out to try and see if the guy stops.  Well, he wasn't stopping and was already far down the hill at this point.  I was initially going to walk down the hill but I took a few steps on the solid ice before starting to slide and caught myself on my truck bed.  Yup, this hill is slick as fuck, and my Nokians are a safer bet than my dress shoes right now.  I exchanged a brief conversation with the guy in the Escape who saw the whole thing happen, and then decided I would climb the rest of the way up the hill, get to my neighborhood where the road is wider, turn around, and go back down the hill to try and find the dude who hit me.  I did this, had no issue getting up the hill or back down.  At the bottom of the hill a couple stopped me and said they saw the guy hit me from down below, but he just kept going past them and they didn't get his plates.  Bummer.  One of them was a former cop and was very happy to be a witness for me, so I took down his info in case I needed to get in touch with him.  Then I trekked onward a ways to see if I could find the black Tahoe.  No dice, it had disappeared.
At this point I'm like well, I better at least call this in and report it as a hit and run.  I called the non-emergency number and of course got an automated ""we're experiencing high call volume, please hold or call back later"".  Obviously they had more important shit to deal with all over the city and I would be pretty low on that totem pole.  So I started making my way back home.  I looped around to take the other route into my neighborhood (also full of icy hills).  Before the hills I get flagged down by someone going the other way.  They adamantly tell me not to try to make it that way, I can't make it, etc.  I assure them that I'm not worried about myself or my truck, and ask them if the road is just slick, or if it's actually blocked.  They weren't sure, so I give them a thanks and decide to continue on.  Well, I get to the first hill in this area, and it's Shitshow Part 2.  Cars off in the ditches everywhere.  The first car off in the ditch (a Chrysler minvan) flags me down and tells me to not try and go farther.  I reassure him that I can make it, I explain that I'm running very good winter tires and being very careful, etc.  So then he changes his tone and says ""ok, well can you tow me out then?""  Ugh, I'm not equipped for this.  I told him ""Well, I would, but I don't have a tow strap, so I can't get you out.""  His response?  ""Oh, I've got one in the back.""
I'm secretly thinking ""well fuck, I want to help this guy, but I don't want to break anything on my truck or his minivan"".  Hmm.  Fuck it, I'm helping this guy.  I tried to get out of the truck and help but was sliding all over the fucking place in my dress shoes, where this guy clearly had better shoes on for ice, so I let him hook up his tow strap to one of my front tow hooks (also nervous as fuck cause I'm not sure if I should tow him out in reverse or turn around and hook him up to my hitch somehow).  The he hooks it somewhere to the frame of his minivan.  We both get back in our vehicles.  OK, moment of truth.  I pop it in 4-low and yell out to the other bystander to relay to him that I'm about to start pulling.  We're both ready, and I start slowly giving her gas.  Holy shit, these Nokians are gripping!  I'm sitting on solid ice, pointed downhill, and these things are gripping while I slowly pull this minivan out of the ditch.  I proceed to pull him to the top of the hill and we both stop (I'll admit I was super nervous about him sliding into me cause his tow strap was kinda short, so I absolutely wasn't going past the crest of the hill with him).  We had a quick high-five, ""fuck yeah!"" moment and start chatting a bit.  We realize we both live on the same street and are just a few houses away.  He's some sort of artist and was on his way to deliver a painting to a client today when he got stuck.  He hopped in his minivan and continued on his way after that.  I assume he made it to the interstate just fine, as it's near there and I got him over the last obstacle.  I hope he made it to his client's and back home safe.  I'll probably swing by his house and check on him this weekend once the ice clears out.  I felt awesome after this whole episode and it made me almost completely forget about the sideswipe earlier.
So after getting him loose, I continued on home past more stuck cars.  I wanted to help them, but I had no towing equipment of my own to help them with.  There was also a lady there with a Jeep pulling people out with her winch, so I didn't feel like I was abandoning all these people.  I was also super nervous about pressing my luck by staying out there any longer.
So I got home, and it was time to assess the damage from the sideswipe earlier.  I cleaned the side of my truck off to where I could see past all the salt and general icy, dirty mess.  It looks like mostly paint transfer.  I bust out the quick dealer and take care of the majority of it.  At this point my hands are getting cold and I decide the rest can wait till a warmer day.  I'm pretty sure all but one spot is just paint transfer that I can clean off and polish out the tougher spots.  There is one small spot I may need a little touchup paint on, but I can probably touch it up and wet sand it and make it look mostly good enough.  Part of my mindset in getting this truck a year and a half ago was ""I want something I can keep for a long time that can take a beating and do the dirty work when weather gets bad so that my nice car is protected"".  Well, it did that job today for sure, and Nokian made a customer for life.  I'm still a bit bummed that a dude would scrape against my truck and then run off, but eh, Lady Karma will have her day with him if she deems it necessary.",2
"Daily Driving a 1996 Jeep Cherokee for a Year (another review!)
Someone recently reviewed a new-ish Jeep Grand Cherokee on here. It was fun to read. I thought y'all might be entertained by a review of one of its ancestors. 
*Model:* 1996 Jeep Cherokee XJ. 4.0 straight 6 and 4 wheel drive. It's ex Forest Service, which means extra skid plates, but no center console, no cup holders, manual everything, and a weird paint color. 
*Pros:*
* It's pretty! It gets lots of ""Jeep waves"" and thumbs-up. People want to talk about my car at gas stations, and always express amazement that it's still allowed on public roads. 
* Acceleration: This thing is much faster than a 23 y/o 4x4 has any right to be. It keeps up with modern traffic, and feels like a Bugatti compared to my old 4 cylinder Isuzu Trooper. It does 0-60 in 9-ish seconds, which is on par with new base model economy cars. 
* Reliability (kind of): Nonessential parts break or fall off on a weekly basis, but all the important parts keep on trucking. It has 230,000 miles and still manages to survive frequent road trips up and down the West Coast. The 4.0 engine is legendary, and the AW4 transmission is boring but bulletproof. It's also very easy to work on, so preventative maintenance is quick, painless, and cheap.  
* Offroad Ability: My Jeep is completely stock apart from a very slight lift. It has open differentials and tires that should be probably replaced soon. It still manages to get me through mud, sand, water, washed out logging roads, and over boulders without skipping a beat. The articulation of two solid axles is hard to beat on a budget 4x4. 
*Cons:*
* Cornering: It doesn't.
* Braking: It doesn't. 
* Safety: It doesn't. The A-pillars are pencil thin, the steering and braking are both shit, and I'm pretty sure my legs are part of the crumple zone. 
* Speed: The speedometer goes to 85. The Jeep goes significantly faster, but anything over 65 will put the fear of god into you. 
* Comfort: Literally the least comfortable car I've ever been in, and I've spent lots of time in 1st gen VW Rabbits and a 1988 Isuzu Trooper. The wind noise is deafening, the engine noise is just as loud, and ride quality is painful. The seats are very thin and are barely adjustable. All the door seals leak. Every single piece of the interior squeaks and/or rattles incessantly. 
* Snow: It's an old school 4x4 with open diffs and no traction control. It still beats 2WD, but any modern AWD crossover will kick its ass on an icy highway. 
* Age: It's a 23 y/o car with high miles. It's not a matter of if something will break, it's a matter of when. 
&#x200B;
*Overall Impression:* Jeep XJ's are fun, engaging, and easy to maintain modern classics. If you're in need of a cheap but capable 4x4 and can look past any body-on-frame related prejudices, they should be on your short list. That said, if you want a cheap, capable, and **100% reliable** 4x4, just get a 4runner like you already knew you should. ",2
"My battle to destroy traffic
The kind with cars. 
after reading several articles. 
- http://jalopnik.com/5538728/how-to-beat-traffic-with-math
- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_phase_traffic_theory
- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_diagram_of_traffic_flow
it is my belief that most traffic problems can be alleviated by employing the 'off-pedal' method.  
   
  when a car breaks, it sends a chain reaction of break-lights going backwards. producing a staggering effect on traffic in that one lane. as the wave travels backwards in THAT lane, any cars from OTHER lanes trying to merge will also slow down, sending the wave propagating through THEIR lanes. Causing the wave to expand on the entire road. 
 The off-pedal method just means that even during the congested parts of the day, you give the car in front of you at least 2 car lengths of space. So that when they tap their breaks to slow down a little, you don't tap your breaks (obviously you would if you're in danger of collision). If 2 or more cars behind your car do the same thing, that space in the traffic flow won't be disrupted. 
When people idly tap their break to adjust speed, people behind them (not all the time) slow down too. 
this is why the 76 of Philadelphia to King of Prussia is in CONSTANT traffic. 
tailgating + tapping on your breaks = traffic
also, when the light turns green if everyone just took their foot of the break, not accelerated, but took their foot off the break, i bet you can get at least 3 more cars through a light.
UPDATE: well, it looks like it doesn't really matter what we do, we can't beat traffic because there are always people who'll cut you off because they see an opening",2
"Now I know why people like Mustangs and V8's. [x-post /r/mustang]
Right now I have a 2000 Honda Prelude (which is for sale by the way if any of you want some sweet FWD VTEC action) and I decided to stop by a dealership and check out their used lot. They had some WRX's I wanted to check out just for the hell of it. One of the sales guys my father and I know comes over and we start talking. The conversation leads to 2 red Mustangs sitting right next to each other, [This Boss 302](http://www.chaplinsvw.com/VehicleDetails/used-2013-Ford-Mustang-2dr_Cpe_Boss_302-Bellevue-WA/2536214993) and this [Mustang GT](http://www.chaplinsvw.com/VehicleDetails/used-2006-Ford-Mustang-2dr_Cpe_GT_Premium-Bellevue-WA/2524919263).
I told our sales friend that I always liked the Boss 302 and he said, ""they're neat cars, but I'd take that GT over that 302."" I asked him why, and he said it had a Whipple supercharger strapped on top and I got quite excited on the inside.
He showed us under the hood, started up the engine, and gave it some nice revs.
Oh. My. God. 
This thing was soooo angry and it sounded absolutely beautiful. I was dying to drive it but testosterone filled me would've gone wild. I'm not exactly sure how much power it puts down but he said he's able to break the wheels at 50 mph. 70 mph the car holds fairly well on hard accelerations. 
One day I will drive you, you angry beast. ",2

First time buying a used car off Craigslist.
A 1997 Honda Civic with ""162,000"" miles on it for $2400.
I checked the Carfax quickly on my phone and it looked alright.
Mechanic took a look. Nothing too crazy. Small leaks, needs new break pads, something minor about an axle rod, etc. Nothing carzy.
Brought it down to $2300.
Afterwards noticed the mileageon the Carfax Last reported at 201k miles.
Texted the guy. 
""Juan"" replaced the odometer tumblers, didn't make a sticker noting it on the car. It was listed it at lower in the ad, and it wasn't mention at the mechanic.
I asked for $150 back - about the difference in the KBB value for the mileage. 
""I can't. The title was already signed.""
These guys flip cars. I'm airing on the side of ignorance rather than malice. I believe one guy fixed it up without noting it, and another guy listed with what he saw on the dial.
Any recommendations? I personally don't care to fight over so little if it's gonna be a huge deal. If it's as simple as threatening with a few simple laws, cool.
How would I go about correcting this in any records? Fill out my own odometer change sticker as accurately as possible?

"Here are some tips for winter driving (based on my own experience)
I'm from Austria and winter can be quite tough here, and since snow clearance service can't be everywhere at the same time, you often have to deal with challenging situations when driving.
So, here are some tips I collected over the years of my driving experience that might will help you to handle such situations. Feel free to correct/extend or critisize my tips.
This list is specially considered for 2WD-vehicles with front-wheel-drive.
* When driving on a snow-covered road the most important part is to not exceed the **traction capability** of your tires. Use the accelerator and (if given) shifting to control your speed rather than braking. 
* Keep in mind that steering also challenges the traction capability of the tires so try to move the steering wheel gently and avoid abrupt steering maneuvers
* If you feel your car starts to break away and you lose control or, even worse, the car starts to spin, DO NOT make abrupt movements when countersteering. Even when you panic, try to countersteer or correct in a smooth and steady way. Put your foot off the accelerator and if you have ABS, brake, but as gently as possible.
* When hill-starting try to start in the second gear. Also, remind the principle of traction. Avoid high revs and -if possible- keep the wheels straight or just slightly-turned to improve the traction transformation.
* When driving uphill and you don't make it, try it in reverse gear.
* Clear your roof from snow and ice debris. It can be a hazard to vehicles driving behind you. It takes you maybe 1 minute more but it can save you and others a lot of trouble.
* Always. Keep. Safety. Distance. Rear-end collisions are mostly a personal negligence. Also, it saves your windshield from being sprayed with dirty snow and mud from the car driving in front of you.
* Swap your front and rear wheels after each winter/each 2 winters (depending on the wear of the tires)
* Don't wait for the engine to heat up in idle mode. It causes unnecessarily high wear to your engine. Clear your car and your windows from snow and *then* start the engine. In some countries you can get a fine for leaving your engine running.
* If you have snow chains, be sure to practice mounting them and have a pair of old gloves in your car. You won't regret it.
* Take a coke bottle (or even smaller) and fill it 50% with defrosting liquid (can be bought cheaply in canisters) and 50% with water. Or you can take pure defrosting liquid and put it in a little spray flask. Keep it in your car in case your windshield washer tank is empty or your door locks/gas cap, whatever is frozen. You can save a lot of money and don't have to buy expensive defrosting sprays which are chemically the same liquid.
* Put a simple tarp on your windshield over night, as long as it isn't wet. You can save a lot of time and don't have to scrape off the ice.
* Do not save your money when it comes down to buying winter tires, if you live in a region where you have to deal with snow covered roads a lot. Rather buy good winter tires that have been used for one winter than buying the cheapest kind of new tires for the same price.",2
"Let's play a game r/cars. Choose one car for the rest of your life.
Like the title says, you get to choose exactly ONE car you're going to own and drive for the rest of your life. Yours free, all maintenance is covered for life; you blow up your engine twice a year, it's replaced for free. Any mods you wanna do (realistically, you can't dump a Hellcat crate engine into an Aveo) are also covered. 
Here's the caveat. This is the ONLY car you can ever drive, forever. Meaning, if the car breaks down and it's something that requires it to be in a garage for a while for parts to arrive for specialized service, you can't drive anything else. You can't drive a second car, you can't rent a car, you're reliant on hitching rides from friends or Uber, or taking public transportation. So, choose wisely.",2
"Chased a flat black Mustang, no hard feelings
On my way home tonight I got a thumbs down from an old beater flat black Mustang.  Traffic patterns put me behind him on the county road portion of the commute.  Then to my surprise, he made the same last right turn that I do every night, onto a couple miles of steep uphill windy country road.  An exciting contest soon followed, as he raced up the hill with me very close behind.  It was fun and I was laughing like a maniac.  Soon we were both trapped behind a minivan, and the race was over.  So I turned around and drove home in a leisurely fashion.  
The last thing I saw was the passenger leaving me one more thumbs down out his window.  Better than the finger, I suppose.  But I just wanted to say, ""Chill out, Mr. Mustang Dude.  We have a shared interest.  We do this because we love the cars, because it's fun, and because we meet cool people.  Yeah, my car might be a little better than yours, but I'm old and I paid more for it.  You probably did a lot more work on yours, and I bet you know more about how to fix it when it breaks.  I just want you to know that I totally respect that primer-covered shitbox Mustang you're driving, and I had a great time on the hill.  No hard feelings, man.  Thumbs up, and let's do it again sometime.""

"New to me 2015 GT PP
Hey r/Cars, I just got home last night and I’ve settled back in I figured I shared my story since my girlfriend is sick of me talking about it!
I used to have a 2012 Camaro that I loved, I bought it when I was 18 and drove it for three years. I taught myself how to drive stick on it, did my first burnout and a whole bunch of other fun stuff. I put about 30k miles on the car between then and this past Saturday when I sold it. 
The long story is, I have always been in love with the s550 ever since they were revealed. Then once I saw one in person I really fell in love. So for the past few years, I’d be browsing car gurus like it was my job always just lusting after buying one. Fast forward 3 years I’m 21 and one night I was browsing mustang6g.com and on the classifieds as usual I stumbled upon this ad. It seemed semi sketchy as there was no pictures attached but I emailed the seller anyway. I found out he was an older gentleman who pretty much babied the car since he bought it. Needless to say I sent him a deposit that night and booked my flight the next day. It was Easter weekend and both of our schedules didn’t line up until the weekend of the 15th. These past two weeks of my life were the most nerve racking in my life. 
However, last night I boarded my plane from Pittsburgh, and flew into Raleigh. I Uber’d to my hotel and I’ll be honest I barely slept a wink, I was too excited too nervous it seemed I just blinked and my alarm was going off at 6am. I got up and went through my morning routine, took an Uber to the Ford dealership for my scheduled PPI. As soon as I pulled in the lot I saw the car. It was gorgeous, the race red looked wet even in the middle of the day and the stance was perfect. I met the owner “Bob” and he was great, we went over all the minor issues (a few paint chips) and then he handed me the folder of documentation he had since purchase. They took the car back and that’s when reality set in. I was in Raleigh 8 hours away from home one step away from owning a car I’ve been lusting over for 3years. The PPI took about 45mins to an hour and I was so nervous. In hindsight, I’ll get a PPI done before I fly down however I didn’t want to get fed false documentation by the P.O.
The PPI came back flawless and I felt like a kid in a candy store. The car looked right, it sounded mean and it was clean. All that was left was some minor documentation. We went to “Bob’s” credit union I gave him the cashiers check and was on my way home. The drive home was pretty uneventful, besides hitting some twisties going through WV and winding it out on some open road it was smooth sailing. I completed my 7:40min journey as said by gps in 7:45 with 2 stops for gas and 3 bathroom breaks. All in all I had a great trip and the car is amazing, I think I’ve looked in the garage 3 or 4 times since I got home to make sure I’m not dreaming. 
Attached are some pics from my journey home. The one is in the credit unions parking lot, seconds after it was officially mine. The second one is her first fill up, I averaged 24mpg so she wasn’t as thirsty as I was expecting. Lastly is just a recording of the trip.
10/10 will be doing again for my next purchase. Hopefully in a few years it will be a new gt500.

"So I got the opportunity to go to spa 24 hour traveling all by myself, here is my journey.
**tl;dr: I went to spa 24 hour yesterday and today, i got terribly lost while exploring the track, it was awful....but it was also an amazing time...and I had the perfect spa experience. I will remember it forever.**
Video for reference, watch it before reading if you'd like
http://youtu.be/-RNy1JXdSWg
This year I made plans to travel to Europe, and just by chance , my travel plans overlapped nicely with the spa 24 hour race in Belgium. 
Long ago, I watched /Drive 's special on the spa 24 hour race and it looked amazing...so I figure I had to get there. 
The drive into the area was fantastic, all kinds of twisty roads that We Americans have no familiarity with, American roads are so boring. European roads have you sitting on the edge of your seat and make you anticipate death at every corner. As an added bonus, all European car rentals are MANUALS, makes me giddy inside.
Anyway...first morning of spa and it is POURING rain, so much rain that I had to stop driving and pull over because it blocked my windscreen.
about 45F weather, sopping wet, and I still couldn't be more excited to get to the race. Hastily I buy an umbrella and try my best to shield myself from the elements before the race starts. Getting positioned up on the hill hundreds of us wait anxiously in the bitter cold for the cars to start their journey.
All lined up for oh rouge (spelling? Lol), they take off on a flying lap, no standing still start this year, too much rain.
Almost immediately I make my way for the walk arounds surrounding the track to try and see every corner in all its glory. 
After walking for about an hour I had seen several different corners at this point but after entering a tunnel and finding myself on a lonely road I begin to wonder....where's the track? I hear the cars roaring, I assumed the back straight was down this road...isnt it?
I've walked too far now to turn back, might as well keep walking and find the track again. Another 20 minutes of walking and strong gusts of wind later my $10 umbrella buckles and breaks, I'm walking along this road aimlessly frozen solid...all I want to do is find the track, see th action.
In a last ditch effort I hitch hike my way to some help. Two young guys pull up next to me and agree to take me 'back to the track' awesome.
A few minutes later they tell me to get out of the car and follow the hill upwards, that I'll find the track there.
I get out and walk again, still raining, I'm drenched. After about 15 exhausting minutes of climbing later I find myself on top of a neighborhood hill, looking down the other side of the hill, I find the track...half a mile away and about 3000 feet down, Jesus Christ where did these guys take me.
I came all this way to see the race, no way some rain or bushes will keep me from witnessing the race. A take off down the hill and make my way through the tall weeds and tall grass. With each marching step I feel my foot sink into grass, water, spiked leaves, and who knows what else. 
I try and fight back the anger, I had been lost for nearly 2 hours at this point, and I was soaking wet, and lost.
Making in 45 minutes down the hill I finally reach the outer fence of the track, thank god. 
But looking around I notice that the fence has no openings, And spiked edges all around, lord help me.
'Fuck it' I say allowed and I climb the fence, trying my best to not cut myself, I do. Fairly good job but at the last second I nick my hand on the top of the fence, I'm fine...but this pisses me off even more.
Cold, miserable, lost, wet, and bleeding from my hand...I couldn't believe that me getting lost would lead to such a cluster fuck of a moment.
But then it hit me....this is why this race is so famous, it's ridiculous, in a ridiculous place, the weather is ridiculous, And it swallows whole both its spectators and the drivers on its track.
This is spa, this is why it's great.
I begun to laugh and March my way back to the paddock. About 40 minutes later I make it back to grand stands just in time for the sun to come out.
The rest of the race was glorious, great weather, great racing, and I didn't get lost again.
My favorite part of the whole thing was the night racing, truly....amazing.
I advise any car buff to make the pilgrimage to spa 24 hour at least once in their life.     ",2
"How would you build your One Lap of America car?
[One Lap of America](http://www.onelapofamerica.com/) just concluded this past weekend. For those who don't know, this is the modern day equivalent of the Cannonball Run, run by the originator's son, Brock Yates Jr. Cars start at the Tire Rack HQ in South Bend Indiana and travel to several different tracks around the country, ending back in South Bend. This year, competitors traveled over 3700 miles and visited 7 different tracks, comprising 19 events. 
Cars that do well are often powerful and setup for track use (stiff suspension, big aero). Average horsepower for the top 10 cars was well over 500. However, they also have to be able to put that power down under any weather conditions and, most importantly, they have to be reliable. One missed event is usually enough to knock a car out of contention. AWD cars typically do well - GTRs in particular have always scored highly, as long as they don't break. 
What would you use to try to win it all? Let's assume the budget isn't enough to purchase a ringer right out of the gate. No Porsche 918s, no Huayras. Try to keep it at or below $50k all in. Remember that you need to pack every tool and article of clothing that you and your codriver will need for an entire week into the car (small trailers allowed) and you also have to have enough fuel to complete the daily commutes in time (sorry Tesla, not quite there yet). It's also helpful to be able to fly under the radar... cops tend to line the highways and they love pulling over exotics. The more time you sit on the side of the road negotiating with a cop, the less you'll sleep later that night.
Anything else goes. Is it best to play it safe with a known contender and go with a mildly modded GTR? How 'bout a track-prepped STi? Or maybe go with a fully customized stealth weapon and put an LS-powered chassis under a Civic wagon body? Let's hear some ideas!",2

"Rental Review - 2018 Kia Rio S, Coming from an E46 Owner
**Background:**  
At home, I have an E46 330ci. Love that car. I've been an enthusiast for as long as I can remember, and that car is everything you could ask for in a first (or any) car. Really the only things I don't love about it are the fact that it's an auto, and that it definitely needs some PM whenever I get the chance. Totally worth it though.  
This summer I'm working across the country at an internship, and in terms of cost, shipping my 330 would be more expensive than renting a car from Hertz (I'm under 25 but got that fee waived via a USAA membership, pro tip). Enter, a 2018 Kia Rio S. Decked out with hubcaps, cloth seats, and painted in non-metallic ""just-the-bare-minimum"" white.  
**Interior:**  
Let's start with the basics. The interior is loaded with plastic. The door armrest is hard plastic. The door panels, the interior trim, everything. The only soft thing is the center arm rest. The seats are cloth, and not that nice cloth (like a [GTI](https://blogmedia.dealerfire.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/374/2015/10/VW-Golf-GTI-plaid-seats.jpg), or the [carbonstructure](https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5504/14342797900_b0a8a7ef26_h.jpg) cloth in an F80 M3). It didn't come with floor mats, and the headliner is as cheap as it gets. What do you expect, it's a rental car! What I will say that really surprised me, is that the actual [interior layout and design](https://www.kia.com/us/en/vehicle/rio-5-door/2018/galleries/interior/?details=gallery_rio-5-door_2018_interior_dash) is very good. It's generally pretty good looking, and same goes for the steering wheel. If it were wrapped in something nice, I think it'd be awesome. Also, the driving position isn't terrible. You definitely have to sit pretty high (I'm around 6'1"") but it's not terrible. My E46 doesn't have the best seating position either, to be honest.  
**Handling:**  
Ok, objectively it handles pretty terribly. The tires are skinny, the steering is god awful, and it feels like a single gust of wind is yanking the car off the road. Every morning my commute is \~20 miles on the highway, so at around 80 MPH the car is getting blown left and right from the wind. I finally understand what car reviewers mean by vague steering. It's as if you're controlling the wheels via a cooked linguine noodle, wearing thick winter gloves, and the bushings are made of Jello. Though, I will say, I had to drive a Kia Sedona for a few days since the rental place didn't have the Rio in inventory at the time. Compared to the minivan, the Rio is like a 918 Spyder. That Sedona felt like something worse than a boat. Respect to the soccer moms out there who manage to pilot that thing without causing accidents everyday. It is entertaining to toss around nonetheless. Also, the brakes bite so severely at the top of the pedal, but as SOON as you start to get into it, they completely disappear. I picture they did this to make it seem like the car brakes well, but they're fucking garbage.  
**Power:**
lol  
**Driving:**  
To clarify, yeah there's absolutely no power whatsoever. Sometimes I merge onto roads thinking I'm driving my E46 and go maybe half throttle or so, and it actually feels like nothing's happening. There's nothing there. Ever. I'm almost always full throttle when I'm trying to do anything (is this what driving a Miata is like?) To be fair, my 330ci only has something like 225 hp and 214 lb-ft so it's no racecar by any means, but that's nearly double what my Kia is putting down right now. You ever taken a ricer fly-by from someone in a Honda Odyssey? It hurts, a lot.  
Quick story: I was driving up a mountain road, and the rental was hanging around 5500 RPM the entire time. Just buzzing away. It needed everything to get up that hill, and the people behind me could tell I was pushing it. I feel like I'd have more mechanical sympathy for my own car, but it's a rental.  
Generally driving is inoffensive. I'm averaging almost 40 MPG compared to 22 MPG from the 330 (mostly highway vs mostly city but still), and it costs around $30 to fill up with regular because fuck it, right? No need for any premium in this thing, and it's nice not having to try to fill up at better quality gas stations. That 1.6 I4 was born for it.  
A personal issue is that you get no respect whatsoever on the road. None. And I don't mean that people don't think you're cool. I mean that someone driving a Dodge Ram (it's ALWAYS a Ram driver) will cut you off out of pure disrespect. Also I see guys with interesting cars like STI's and an occasional M3 and I think ""hey guys, I like cars too!""  
**Overall Take:**  
Honestly, it's a POS econobox. But I'm having so much fun driving it. With my E46, I baby it. I treat it really nice and make sure it's always clean and vacuum it out and get maintenance done. I do ring it out a lot but, I check the fluids all the time, I listen closely for any sounds, and don't abuse it. But in the Rio, who cares. If I'm going anywhere, I'm full throttle. I mean, I could wail on it full throttle for 8 seconds and still not break any speeding laws on the interstate. The closest thing this car will ever see to a wash is when I drive past some sprinklers. You can beat it up and it keeps going, and that's awesome.  
I actually kinda like this thing. I'd never buy one in a million years for myself, but for what it's worth it's great. Not saying they're alike, but I think I totally understand the appeal of Miatas now (some people are going to be furious with that comparison). But I see the appeal in a great handling, small, reliable, good looking car that you can beat on all the time with few repercussions (a Miata, that is). The Kia isn't those things, besides capable of being beat to hell.   
You should try driving an appliance of a car, it can be pretty entertaining.  
**TL;DR:** Yes, it's the automotive equivalent of a washing machine, that's cheap in every way and has no performance capability whatsoever, but it'll make you laugh and you'll have more fun than you probably deserve to. Still no E46 though (;",2
"New to the world of cars
I'm sure people before me have had this dilemma, and I'm sure I won't be the last. I am fresh out of highschool, and in need of a vehicle to get me from A to B reliably. It probably goes without saying, but I will say it anyway. I do not have much money at all, and a lot of the jobs out there that are within my grasp (such as a delivery driver) require a vehicle. I was wondering if it would be possible to get something for around $1000. Just something that can get me from A to B, and won't break down every other day.

"""What kind of window tint film should I use?""  An original guide to window tint films.
First of all, there is a **TL;DR** section at the bottom.  You're welcome.
I originally published this guide in the form of a comment in /r/BMW, and it seemed to get some positive reviews (just going by upvotes alone).  I figured, ""Why not share this bit of information and toss in a few extras for /r/cars?""  I know many people ask on a regular basis what type of tint film to use, so hopefully this will give some clarification on the much-debated subject.  Now that I think about it, asking what film to use is like asking what kind of car to buy:  You're going to get six million different opinions, some could be helpful and some are absolute crap.  All I want to do is help ensure you get the right tint you're looking for and you don't end up buying something you don't like.
Let's break down the different types of film:
Dyed film basically just creates shade inside the car. It will stop a good chunk of UV rays, cooling the car off to a degree (no pun intended). These are cheap, plentiful, and very common. Sadly, with many of the lower end films, they tend to become discolored over time (generally turning a funky purple color), bubble easily due to their poor adhesive properties, peel, flake, etc.
Metalized films create the shade effect like dyed films, stopping a large portion of UV rays. Due to the added metal element, they will reflect back a portion of the infrared light as well, stopping even more heat from getting into the car. The downside to metalized films is simple: it's made with metal. Cell phone signals will probably be decreased, antennas wired in windows (much like in BMW's) will not work as well, radar detectors will not work as well... See where this is going? For older cars without much technology inside and out, a metalized film would be perfect.
Ceramic films are supposedly the ""crème de la crème"" of window tint. They stop UV rays (usually 99% of them, give or take), most of the infrared light and the heat associated with it (the darker the tint, the more infrared it will stop from what I can tell). Unlike metalized films, ceramic films will not interfere with radio signals, radar detectors, etc. The biggest drawback associated with ceramic film is usually the price. Ceramic films tend to be the costliest of all the films, but they work wonders.
On the note of ceramic film: A customer at one shop was coming back to get her windshield tinted^1 with a 70% (75%?) ceramic film, which is basically clear. Although quite transparent, it will still stop a lot of the UV and infrared light from penetrating through the windshield. Her other windows and sunroof were tinted at 30% with ceramic film. She claimed that with just the windows and sunroof tinted at 30% with ceramic film, she left her car out in the sun with a glass of ice water sitting in the cup holder. The ice barely melted after 90 minutes of exposure in the hot Alabama sun.  By adding some film to the windshield, she was going to have one hell of a cool car.
Personally, that was impressive enough to convince me that ceramic film is the way to go.
Personal opinion time. (Brace yourselves...)
Ceramic film performs astronomically. Not only does it stop UV rays, it stops a major chunk of infrared heat. A shop quoted to do my E46 330Ci for ~$400. Pricey, but it was the same film the woman I mentioned above used. The shop I visited also had a heat lamp set up where you put your hand underneath it and used various films from different manufacturers to determine which stopped the most heat. Ceramic film, without question, was the most impressive. I've yet to get it installed, mainly because the film is quite expensive, but in the world of window tinting, you generally get what you pay for.
I hope this helps.

**NOTE 1:** Thank you [verdegrrl](http://www.reddit.com/user/verdegrrl) for the following snippet of information.
>Some tints have a polarizing element to them. If you install them and use polarized glasses, the world can become this strange purple and green swirling psychedelic effect. We put some 70% 3M on the R32 side windows and it's driving me mad.
>
>The colour is also rather blue/green, rather than grey like the Huper. That might be a problem for some.
**NOTE 2:** [Check your local window tinting laws.](http://www.tintcenter.com/laws/) It varies from state to state on the darkest you can go, so please read up before you invest $400 on ceramic film, only to have a police officer tell you to get it removed.  If you do go below the legal limit, you take full responsibility for that decision and understand there is a risk of being fined or ticketed.

**TL;DR...**
* Dyed Films = Cheap but reasonably effective at stopping some heat.
* Metalized Films = Not good for electronics, but more effective at stopping heat than dyed films.
* Ceramic Films = Highly rated and generally has the highest heat rejection, but tends to be expensive.

"Engine Mystery Solved – Always remember to change your oil.

My 1997 Saturn SL2 had a bad knocking noise when I bought it for a few hundred bucks last month. Apparently the guy didn’t change his oil much, but when I bought it, the oil looked black, but nothing terrible. I got the car cheap because of the knock, and as a mechanical engineer, was determined to root cause it. This is my explanation/theory on what happened – feel free to correct it if you think parts are wrong.
I figured the knock was probably a rod bearing after checking lots of things on the top, the previous owner telling me it burned a little oil, and the overall consistency of the noise. 
The pictures show that after I pulled the oil pan, I discovered I could wiggle the rod bearing back and forth over a full mm (about 70 thou) I had “forged” bearings.
http://i.imgur.com/SeBi4.jpg
http://i.imgur.com/8EsyZ.jpg
Dirt had been passed into the crank rod bearings and tore up the number 2 cylinder enough to create a tiny clearance between the two, just enough that the oil could no longer bridge it. And a gentle pinging sound was born, growing imperceptibly thousands of times per minute as the rod slammed into it each time it went around. 
Here’s a side by side of what the #2 and #3 rod journal bearings look like.
http://i.imgur.com/xavax.jpg
http://i.imgur.com/PbSc9.jpg
I swapped the crank for a new one ($140 with bearings after an Advance Auto coupon code) and dropped the engine back in. All good right?
http://i.imgur.com/vCBxs.jpg
http://i.imgur.com/KVZpH.jpg
Almost. Engine runs perfectly, except for a steady stream of smoke coming out of the tailpipe. 
Head gasket right? So after swapping a crank while the engine was out, putting it back in, realizing that the head had to come off, and then realizing that I had to drop the oil pan that I had so painstakingly sealed up again was enough to make me a little mad. 
Wrong…
I pulled off the head and said to myself – “one of these things is not like the others…”

And the cylinder walls are almost perfect
http://i.imgur.com/hxSoZ.jpg
But the head isn’t quite so good
http://i.imgur.com/MCd2J.jpg
So. Here’s the synopsis. Engine oil doesn’t get changed, dirt builds up, begins scarring crank bearing #2. Bearing collects more dirt because there’s more room, and soon the journal begins to wear down. As the journal wore down, the piston was allowed to go higher and higher into the cylinder, and was able to smash ever so lightly into the cylinder head. Because of the shape of the head, only parts of the piston were able to contact, and those failed first, but very slowly, because the journal was wearing down slowly. This allowed the hypereutectic pistons (strong aluminium alloy) to break apart very slowly, into tiny little pieces, not large enough to cause significant scoring on the cylinder walls. This explained the sparkling oil in the pan, and all the oil that was getting burned. 
So tomorrow I get my new piston, and hopefully I get see if the root cause is finally determined.",2
"2016 Mustang GT started making some weird noises/vibrations while driving. Taking it in soon, but looking for some more knowledgeable opinions than mine.
So just yesterday, my Mustang started making a noise from 10-25mph. It's a whirring noise, almost sounds like a machine powering up (while accelerating), and then from 25-0, its the same noise, but it sounds like a machine powering down/whirring down.
On top of that noise, while driving at 20-40 mph, theres a vibration coming from the handbrake that at certain points is *audible*, but mostly its easiest to feel it when I put my hand on the ebrake. It's a weird, almost inconsistent vibration, mixed with a feeling of possibly metal grinding somewhere.
Was about to get on the highway yesterday but as soon as I reached 40 it just felt...wrong. The vibration and noise weren't undriveable, but it absolutely had me feeling like something was gonna break if I went faster. So I turned around, went home, and parked it. Not driving it until Monday when I take it to the dealership.
On top of both those things, cold starts seem more rackety in the engine/below the engine, only since yesterday though. 
A quick google search shows something called the pinion gear(?) in the differential, or possibly a transmission thing. Anyone experienced something similar? By far the biggest thing is the whirring noise, which is similar to a noise I heard with cheaper/shittier tires, but the tires were just rotated and balanced about 3000 miles ago, and inspected again 500 miles ago and they were all perfect. 
Thanks for any help.
Edit : Phoned the dealership, explained what was going on like I did in this post, they told me to bring it in. Their diagnostic is a pinion bearing, which is apparently 8 hours of labour, and they won't be able to start working on it till next week. But it should all be under warranty, which is nice.",2

"Guy is suing me claiming my oil changed damaged his engine. Plz help
Hey everyone,
I own a mechanic shop and one night before closing this dude comes in for an oil change. He has a 2012 Mercedes C250. All we did was a simple oil change. Drain, fill and replace filter. After turning the vehicle on right away the engine starts making a rattling sound, the check engine line turns on. We spent about a good hour trying to figure out what was going on. So we told the guy to bring it back when it’s not late. Then the noise goes away, and he finally drives off. Calls me back and says the noise is back and now his car is jerking and acting funny. Told him to bring it back it never does. A week later I get a call from his mechanic saying “yea man looks like your oil changed damaged his cam sprockets” and I’m like huh? How are you about to make that assumption. Anyway this guy is getting mad he calls threatening us saying he’s gonna sue us, I’ve told him multiple times saying “just bring the car to us” and he never does. Month goes buy bureau of automotive repair gets involved. He’s going back and forth trying to mediate the situation. After investigating for a few weeks he says the same thing “yea so we don’t know if the cam sprockets are damaged, or the  actuators that power them, so it’s better off just replacing the motor” at this point I’m being bullied, and being intimidated into believing my oil changed caused this. So after doing some extensive research this vehicle is known for having camshaft, cam sprocket, timing chain failure. 
A quick history for the Mercedes he brought in. It had about 150k miles on the body, second he’s already had the engine replaced in the vehicle once so this going to be his 3rd engine, and second he was over 1k miles over his oil change. 
Anyway he’s taking me to small claims and wants $9500 for a car that’s worth less than $5k. I feel like I’m being scammed and this isn’t right. Please tell me what you guys think or if you have any questions."

"Offering FREE manufacturer repair procedures/manuals
Hey everyone,
I usually make this post when ever I get a chance, since it seems to help a lot of people, but it usually dies down and gets archived, so here I am making another, hoping it is okay with the moderators.
It is better to post questions to this thread so I can keep track of my replies and where I stopped last.
**PLEASE, PLEASE, post your request using the following format:**
**Car year, make, model, engine,trim/style, transmission/drive-train, repair procedure.**
Example: 2006, Chevrolet, Trailblazer, 4.2L engine, 4WD/Automatic, replacing fan clutch.
A VIN number alone would work, but if you mess up a digit then you could get a different car entirely.
Usually, if I think you might need supplementary procedures, I will add those with you asking.
**PLEASE SPECIFY WHAT PART YOU NEED FIXED, AND NOT A SYSTEM (for example: ask how to remove ball joint and NOT please give me everything on suspension , or ask how do I remove fuel injectors NOT please give me everything on the engine).**
**FOR THE LOVE OF CARS, PLEASE DON'T ASK FOR ""ALL THE MANUALS"":**
I get a lot of requests for ""give me all the manuals"". Most resources nowadays require manual procedure selection and have massive libraries, so not only would it take forever, it would also be a couple of GB that are hard to upload and take as long as well.
Note: (Sometimes car year, make, and model are enough for certain things but it's faster to have everything).
Note: I am offering repair manuals, not car advice (please don't ask me ""why is my 2005 Honda Civic is leaking coolant from somewhere"", as it needs to be diagnosed personally). However if you have symptoms, I might be able to use the database to find out what could be causing the issue or what is most likely from those causes.
Note: 99% of the cars requested will have what you need (I have managed to help with full transmission rebuilding for some classic cars), however sometimes cars/procedures may not be found -in which case I will let you know.
**EDIT: THANK YOU ANONYMOUS FOR THE GOLD <3**"
"Thanks for the Subreddit
Hey everyone I just wanted to say thank you for this subreddit. This is a very valuable resource which helps poor schmoes like myself fix up their daily drivers or project cars. I currently utilize a 97 Honda Civic as my daily driver and while I've used YouTube primarily to fix the issues that have come up with my car. I see threads on here every day that get quality advice. I've never been a mechanically inclined person so being able to ask questions and get them answered by more experienced people is freaking amazing. So far for my car I have fixed a couple of issues: changed out ignition lock cylinder, cleaned out o2 sensors and my catalytic converter, replaced fuel filter, done my own oil changes, replaced my radiator, replaced my hood after a small fender bender, replaced my hood release latch, changing transmission fluid this weekend. It's nothing crazy but without places like this I wouldn't have been able to do any of it. Again thanks and have a great day!"

"Hey, just wanted to thank you guys for the help.
I'm the dumbass that jacked up my impala on the control arm. 
I can't believe how fast and accurately you guys responded. It blew my mind. Honestly, a few people (not mechanics at all) told me I should be fine to drive on it but I was skeptical, so I came here. 
I appreciate the lack of absolute dickhead responses. Look, I'm no mechanic and I don't claim to be. I've jacked up a couple cars in my day and even this car a few times without an issue (not on the control arm). But the truth is I made a really retarded mistake and you guys didn't crucify me for it. So thank you. 
I learned something and I'm alive instead of listening to my other sources of ""wisdom"". I'm borrowing another vehicle so I can make it to a handful of interviews for a new career path. Wish me luck.

"How to maximize the life of a new car?
Hey all,
I was reading this morning about how it's actually helpful for the engine to occasionally push it hard in order to reduce carbon build up in the cylinders and valves.
So beyond following the manufacturer's recommended maintenance schedule, how do you maximize the life of your car?
\- Occasionally push the engine hard?
\- Follow a break-in period?
\- Ignore ""Lifetime"" transmissions and change the fluid anyway?
\- More frequent oil changes?

"Shop says they accidentally cut rear brake Line when replacing fuel filter
Hey so I've got a 2001 VW Golf which needed the usual consumables swapped (Air filter, Cabin filter, Oil and Oil filter and Fuel filter); I went to a good shop in my town, their prices are kinda high but they always do good work, and left the car there over night because they were busy and they had put me on a list. The next morning I get a call from them and they say they replaced the oil, the oil filter, air and cabin filter but when they attempted to remove the fuel filter they snapped the rear brake cable too. Is that even possible, and if so how would that happen ? They also want me to pay for it for some reason but I'm gonna go speak to the manager anyway, I just wanna know if what they're saying sounds legit."

"Midas failed me on my state inspection wrongly, I'm broke and wondering what to do
Please note first off I'm 21, going though a rough financial time and know nothing about cars. 
So i went into Midas for a state inspection, I usually don't like to go to big name brands for car stuff because of stuff like this but I thought hey, it's just an inspection what could really happen? 
Well they nearly convinced be to replace a serpentine belt in my chevy malibu 2012 because it was cracked and worn which would fail me on the steering part of the inspection. That would cost me 140 bucks. They've already racked my bill up a hundred already, all thay stuff genuine.  Luckily my mom reminded me of a warranty i have with the ppl i bought the car from, and told me serpentine belts is one of those things Midas and places love to screw people on. So I said hold up, paid for everything else and went to the people I bought my car from. 
They told me they're pretty sure I have electronic power steering, which the serpentine belt has nothing to do with the steering. As well, the guu used to be a dmv inspection person and said they dont fail cars for belts. They sent me to my manufacturer to make sure, and my manufacturer agreed with all and also told me my belt isn't even cracked. 
So, my question is should I take this to the dmv and report Midas? The guy at the dealership said yes, manifacturer guy said don't even bother and take the loss and save the time, that goes for trying to get my money back for the inspection too. As well, as someone being broke 60 bucks is a lot of money and two inspections will make sure I'm barely eating. So if I take this to the dmv, tell them what Midas failed me wrongly for, will they maybe overturn it? Maybe on top of that get ny money back? Or just take the L, get a new inspection at my manufacturer for another 30 bucks and go and also try to get my money back or just follow what the manufacturer guys said? 
Thanks to anyone and sorry for my ignorance, I only have a vague idea about whats really going on with my car but I trust mt manufacturer. "
"Is it weird to go to a mechanic and ask ""hey, I am doing a road trip. can you please take a look at it?""
Hi guys,
I will be driving to Niagara Falls this weekend which is about 400 miles away from me - so I will be putting about 800 miles over the period of three days.
My car is a 2004 Mustang - which hasn't given me any issue since ignition coil failed in 2015 and fuel pump failed in 2016. But it does give me a pause about driving 800 miles in a cold weather. It does struggle a bit to start at 8F weather, but never had an issue of not starting. 
So my question is - is it normal to go to a mechanic and say ""hey i have zero issues but can you take a look at it to see if it could handle a mini road trip?""
Also the secondary question is - is there a benefit to getting it checked before? "

"Help - Craigslist buyer saying I sold him cracked rims. Not a car guy - feedback from experts?
Hey guys - I need some help. I sold a set of wheels/tires on Craigslist and now I have the buyer going apeshit on me saying I sold him cracked wheels. He's claiming they were cracked, but I think he's the one who trashed them.
I bought them a year ago and never put them on my car. They're typical inexpensive big wheels - set of Tenzo Mesh Type 19""x8.5"" 5x114.3 with a +17 offset. They had some cheapo Federal summer tires on them that were basically new - I sold it all for $545 to a guy w/ some tuner lugs (not a full set) and the hub rings. Now he's saying I owe him his money back because 3 wheels are cracked.
The wheels all looked good to me, I cleaned them off before selling them. He inspected the wheels before buying - saying that he was looking for cracks. They passed his inspection and he bought the wheels. He had asked me beforehand if they would fit his 2001 Lexus SC430 - I told him I had no idea. 
His story was that once they were on the car, he drove it and they were wobbling. He brought it to a shop and they told him 3 rims were cracked. He sent me pictures and I don't know what a 'fresh crack' looks like - but if I had to guess, it would be like this. The cracks are obvious and white on black rims - I'm not sure how he would have missed the crack, or how I would have missed the cracks.
Here are the pics he sent me of the cracks & his car on the lift: http://imgur.com/a/wb1bR
What would cause them to crack like this? 
* It looks like the offset is incorrect and they're sticking off the body of his car. 
* There was no air in the tires, so if he didn't inflate them before driving on the rims, I assume that could crack them?
* I didn't give him a full set of lugs - so maybe they were wobbling because he tried to drive without them being evenly attached with all the lugs on the wheels?
What's your take? 
**EDIT3: I emailed his craigslist posting asking for a pic of them on his car. He sent me a photo taken with his cell phone, I read the exif data and the wheels were mounted on his car 9am the day before he called me saying he wanted his money back. He called me at ~2pm the following day. Responding to my inquiry about HIS craigslist posting, he told me they're in good condition with no scratches. I'll chock this up to another Craigslist scumbag. Always use a burner phone number, always get a signed 'bill of sale' that states 'as is' and 'inspected by: _____', and keep yourself protected. Glad I didn't send him any money after the fact.**
----------
**EDIT2: He just re-listed them on craigslist for $600 'firm'.**
----------
EDIT: I've had a few hours to think about this a little more. I think I know what happened. I gave him everything I had with the wheels, including the lugs and hub rings from the previous car. I looked into the inner diameter of the hub pilot for the Lexus and it's off by 6mm+, so about 1/4"". So I'm guessing he just mounted the wheels using the wrong rings and didn't check the sizes. I sold them to him on a Wednesday and he was calling me by Saturday morning saying they were cracked. I don't think he ordered the correct rings and that explains the wobble he told me about on the phone. If he was driving at any speed, this could cause the wheels to bang around - it would be even worse if the pressure wasn't correct. 
But this goes along with his story and would make sense. Wrong hub rings, incorrectly seated wheels, wobble while driving, and cracking of 3/4 wheels. "

"Mechanic holding my car for ransom for what appears to be his own mistake, need advice...
Hey guys, first time posting here. Got an issue, not so much about dealing with a mechanical problem but a problem with a mechanic.
I have a 1986 Toyota Corolla SR5 with the 4-AC engine.
Last monday the front main seal failed and the car started puking oil. Called my mechanic (Mechanic A, this is part of a national chain of franchisees) the next day to get a price quote, and he couldn't find the seal right away (part numbers for this car are notoriously hard to get right as there were 6 different Corolla models for that year) so I offered to go to the Toyota dealership and get the part for him. I've had to source my own parts in the past, no big deal, and he's worked on the car before. He replaced the timing belt for me back in March. This is important.
Get the part on Wednesday, get the car into him first thing on Thursday. It's a $260 repair job to take off all the belts and pulleys and replace the seal, so a few hours worth of work.
I pick up the car Thursday afteroon, and drive it 50 miles to an event with no problem. Fire the car up again to go out to get food after I'm there for an hour and there's a horrendous rattling/grinding noise from the engine. I couldn't identify it because while I'm learning about the car the more I have it, I have no idea what's going on at that exact time. I call Mechanic A back and he tells me to drive it back if I can. The car runs and revs fine, just that noise. About halfway home, the car starts to lose power and I can't get it to rev above 3k at all. Barely make it back the next day to the mechanic, the car dies, and won't start again.
The guy who originally worked on the car tries to help me diagnose what the problem is. It's an older car that runs great 99% of the time, and he insists it couldn't be the timing because he didn't mess with it. It has fuel, it has spark, it just won't catch. He thinks it's the carb, and since he doesn't work on them, tells me to push it to Mechanic B (in the same strip mall, another national franchise chain) because they can work on carbs. I do so, but because this is Friday he tells me he won't be able to get to it until Monday evening to try and diagnose it.
I end up doing more research that night including talking to all of my AE86 buddies, and the unanimous conclusion is that the timing was messed up, especially since the belt was just removed and replaced to get to the seal.
I get a rental car because I have to leave Monday night for a week's worth of training for my job out of town, and I can't rely on Mechanic B getting the car fixed by the time I need to leave.
I swing by Mechanic B as they're closing, and he tells me that the timing belt is completely shredded. The belt tensioner is loose, and not even bolted properly to the block. He takes photos of this. His opinion is that Mechanic A didn't put the tensioner back on properly when he put the belt back on, which caused the 10 month old belt to shred itself the second time I fired the car up (and that's what was making the noise I heard). Mechanic B took video and pictures of the timing cover being removed as a CYA thing to where you can see the tensioner bolts loose and coming out of the block.
Mechanic B helps me push the car back to Mechanic A and tells him what he found, that the tensioner is loose and the belt shredded. Mechanic A agrees to look at it and if they made a mistake with the timing belt, fix it under warranty. I'm polite - I understand shit happens sometimes, but if they can make it right, I'll be happy. I'll figure out if I can get reimbursed for the rental car later.
Today all hell broke loose on the phone. I get a text from Mechanic B that Mechanic A stormed into his office cussing him out for fucking up my car. I call Mechanic A. His claim is that Mechanic B screwed up my tensioner, including stripping the bolt in the block. Mechanic A insists he never touched the tensioner (right off the bat, I don't believe this at all because you HAVE to mess with the tensioner to get the belt off) and that he was willing to eat the cost of the belt ""to make me happy"" but would have to charge me labor to fix Mechanic B's fuckup in stripping the tensioner bolt hole in the block, and removing the alternator belt to get to it.
I try to point out to Mechanic A that even if Mechanic B had been responsible for the tensioner mount having issues, the belt shredded BEFORE Mechanic B was even involved, I called him as soon as it happened, and he TOLD me to take it to Mechanic B because he couldn't diagnose why it wouldn't start.
His response: ""Well, because Mechanic B messed with the tensioner, we can't verify that what we did caused your timing belt to shred. I'm doing you a favor offering to replace the belt and only charging you the labor to re-tap the block.""
My response: ""So you mean to tell me the part you replaced ten months ago failed two hours after you took it off and put it back on, through sheer coincidence?""
Mechanic A: ""It's a 30 year old car, things break.""
So this is where we're at right now. Mechanic A is refusing to fix the car unless I agree to pay to fix Mechanic B's supposed mistake.
I need to get the car back on Friday when I get back into town.
For the record, I don't believe Mechanic A for a second when he says he never touched the tensioner. Also Mechanic B wouldn't have had to touch it to see the belt was shredded.
What are my options here? The quickest way I can see is to just suck it up and pay what Mechanic A is asking it because I NEED this car back on Friday no matter what and he knows this. 
If I do that, are my chances hurt if I decide to dispute or take him to small claims court for the cost of the rental vehicle (nearly $300)?
I could probably go all righteous fury and demand he fix the car AND pay for the rental, but if I do that, I know for a fact there's no way I'll get my car back on Friday because he'd just spite me.
Advice appreciated. I hate being put into situations like this."
"How exact does spark plug gap need to be?
Hey guys. A bit confused here, hope I didn't mess up. 
2015 Subaru that calls for NGK Iridium spark plugs gapped at 0.044"". 
Bought four online, and adjusted the gap on someof them as they off - go figure! 
Did the spark plug job and checked the old plugs, which were the originals at 60k miles. They were all equal and all low, at 0.035"", which is 0.009"" less or over 20% lower than spec.
Now that I've done the job, I can't tell if it's just in my head but the car seems to have less power now. It was already a sluggish engine to begin with it but it feels like I need to floor it even more. Also, the gas mileage has dropped from 25 MPG to 22.5 MPG.
The odd thing is, it idles smoother than it ever has. Since I bought it brand new, it would have a slight shake at idle at a stop light, and would shake even more if the AC compressor was on. I figured it was just a Subaru thing. After this change, it idles completely smooth - can't even tell the car is running. Far from any misfires or anything.
Also, the weather has gotten colder - wonder if that could be what's affecting gas mileage coincidentally.
So my first question is, what could cause this? I figured if I gapped wrong there would be other symptoms like rough idle and such, but nothing.
Second, how close does gap need to be? I have to admit, my gauge is just one of those simple circular ones. I may have adjusted the gaps anywhere from 0.042"" to 0.045"" as it's hard to tell the difference. Is that bad?
Would the gaps being so much higher than the originals (despite matching spec) cause it to run smooth, but have less power?
What sort of symptoms should I keep an eye on in the future to make sure I didn't mess up?
Thanks"

I can't count how many people come to me immediately after buying a car. ""Hey I just bought a car, can you look it over?"" I usually have some pretty bad news after looking at the car.

"[96 Mazda Miata] AAA just reversed the terminals when trying to jump my car...
Hey. So I've got a per-mile service that runs off an OBD scanner... Unfortunately I've been working on my Miata for a good month and the scanner ran the battery out while it's been sitting. I tried jumping it with my WRX, and it went from completely dead to the electronics starting, but it still wouldn't turn over even after running the WRX for ~20 minutes. Figured I'd try it again with my gf's Camry instead the next day... No dice. So I figured I'd call AAA since why not, maybe a starter would give it more juice.
So, I give them a call and a guy comes out. Nice dude, but he skips doing a check on the battery health since he sees it's a brand-new battery, only ~2 months old since I bought it. He hooks it up, and... he puts the positive on the negative and the negative on the positive. Asks me to crank the car, absolutely nothing now- not even the electronics. I tell him I think his starter is on wrong, and he then says something like ""no, I think this is the negative"" but tries to swap it and asks me to crank again... And of course there's still nothing.
So this is, uh, great. I'm not familiar with what swapping the terminals would do - where should I start from troubleshooting this? Would doing that only do something like blow a starter fuse, or would this have damaged more? (And I think I know the answer to this, but should I file some sort of complaint about this..? He offered to tow and I didn't really want anyone looking at this any further for the moment, so I refused it.)"
"Do you guys unplug dashcams when servicing a vehicle?
Hey all,
Took my car for her first service yesterday, after having installed a dashcam a couple of weeks ago.
I was curious to see how the dealer treated her, so I pulled up the footage and the guy driving was super careful coming out of the dealership driveway (thanks man!), and then he went for a docile drive around the block to where their actual service garage is located. As he was pulling into the driveway there, he unplugged the dashcam...? You can hear when he puts his hand on the unit, and then it turns off. There's no footage from that point onwards, up until I got the car back a couple of hours later. This means they took it from where it gets serviced to where it gets washed, and then back to the dealership again, and plugged it back in once it was parked in the carpark.

"ASE mechanic of 10 years, looking for career/professional advice on leaving current employer. Warning: long.
So where to start? I’ve been wrenching professionally for about a decade at various shops. I’ve been ASE certified for most of that time. I’ve been with my current employer for 3+years. It’s a good shop, and one that I originally started at years ago as a live and tire tech. I’m currently the lead mechanic (by default) and I’m pretty damn good at my job.
Our owner has changed a lot of things over the past few months, mostly policies regarding pay. We are not a franchise shop, so sometimes our boss has to take a hit if a week is slow. I know, legally, there should be no trickle down and we should get our wages regardless. He changed our pay day from every Friday to the following Monday. His reasoning was that the bank posts payroll money into his account that money, so he doesn’t have to worry about bounced checks. Fair enough. We all took a weekend or three to adjust and life was good for a few weeks.
He then stopped giving us the option of direct deposit, and instead printed out checks. Again, no huge deal, although with this method we stopped getting our pay stubs unless we specifically asked him for it. 
Then came the “hey, can you make sure you don’t put this on the bank until tomorrow” talk. Then came the “oops, forgot to do that yesterday, here’s your Tuesday check” coupled with him asking not to deposit it that night.
There are other financial red flags that have been going up, that I’ll not get into on here. But through this whole process, my other half and I were closing on our first home, so quitting this job wasn’t an option. So I sit here on Wednesday, the boss has gone home for the day, and no word on if he’s paying us today. 
Morale is pretty low to say the least. One guy put in his notice, but the other mechanic (he’s been in this shop since back when I was new) are both at our wits end. Our boss is generally a pleasant dude, but we don’t work here to be his friend. We have bills. Luckily I have some savings to ride me over if it gets really bad.
Now, our owner is not a shady crook. We’re honestly concerned that either his health/age are affecting him, or that he has some other thing draining his money. I don’t think I’d feel right if I brought the law into this, but it’s getting ridiculous and I’ve got a life to live. Honestly, I throw down at least 60% of the hours in the shop, on a 3 man team. If I leave, this shop is sunk.
So I guess I’m just looking for some guidance. Obviously the payroll stuff is shady as all getout, and leaving this place is the logical step, but we aren’t sure if this is something we can help fix. I’m polishing my resume tonight and putting it wherever I can. I’m not even sure I want to stay in this business, since I’m pretty much emotionally drained and my back is shot (in my early 30s). I think I just need some solid advice on how to be tactful here. It’s a bad situation all around."

Hey guys!

"Do you mind if a customer makes a suggestion of what they think a problem is based on research and solid evidence?
I made an appointment for an oil change with my mechanic and asked if he could check something else out for me. I was having some problems recently (I don't really need to mention what) that he couldn't figure out what it was. I did a lot of research and asked a lot of questions on this sub and I'm 98% sure I know what the problem is based on my research and the symptoms of the problem. I basically told him ""Hey I did some research and apparently this is a common problem with my truck. I think it's this because of these symptoms. Could you check it out for me?"" Is this rude? Do you appreciate customer input if it sounds like they know what they're saying? "

"Guys. I really messed up on this one. Need help badly.
Hey guys! First of all thank you for clicking my post. A little support is what I need. Okay here's the issue:
 Firstly, I saw this Tiburon in a private selling website. It's basically Craigslist but it's Canadian(Kijiji). Me and my son went to this guy and while I was talking to my phone, I stupidly left my son and the seller in his shop. Not knowing the fact that stupidity is hereditary, my son started the car, not knowing the fact that its eBrake is broken, he just went through the drywall because he placed it in First gear so that car won't move. 
I was forced to buy the car because he gave me a better deal instead of paying the damages that my son did. Now the issue is, I have to double clutch when shifting because the transmission won't engage. I know about these issues by the way because the seller mentioned it. So here I am, with a good car that's in sh*t condition. My choices are: Selling the Car or doing a clutch job. I really love the car but I don't know how a clutch job approximately costs. I talked to the buyer again, he said he wasn't sure if it's either the flywheel or the clutch. The car howls when its stationary, you have to double clutch to shift into gears(or it won't let you shift), and it takes full manpower to shift it. The body is in good condition, the clutch(or the flywheel) is the only issue. 
So Thanks again for reading my post! If you guys could give me a suggestion, I would be really grateful. Thanks in advance!"

"Badly smoking 1960's era 3-71 Detroit generator on a historic tugboat, temporary fix ideas?
Hey guys, so one of my projects is the maintenance of the world's oldest operable wooden tugboat. The main engine (the tug's 3rd engine) is a 1934 slow turning, reversing, diesel that has an air start. In order to build air pressure, we have an aux generator that is turned by a Detroit 3-71, which turns a 110vDC generator, that turns a 25HP 110vDC air compressor, that fills up our 4 100-gallon air tanks to 250PSI. 
Unfortunately, the 3-71 is in bad need of a rebuild, as it smokes pretty bad, it leaks oil, and it cannot maintain good oil pressure when hot and at idle. (Of course, with these engines, they say if there isn't oil under it, there isn't oil in it). Unfortunately, someone other than myself didn't realize the point about low oil pressure at a warm idle, and left it idling for an hour or two while we were going to drydock last summer, and ever since, she's been smoking worse than Dickens' London. I know we need a rebuild on her, and we're looking into that, but we're a nonprofit, so money comes slowly. A full rebuild kit (with injectors) is only about $1,000, but we want to try and limp her along through the busy season so we can show off the parts of her that need the air. 
So, I was considering a stop-gap to allow us to run the 3-71 without getting complaints about our smoke output, and was thinking about trying an oil additive. Something like Restore, or Rislone Ring Seal. 
Are there any thoughts on this? Is there a good additive that may cut the oil burn for 20-50 hours of operation that won't kill the scavenging pump (gear-driven roots-style blower... the x71 series are 2 stroke diesels)? A full rebuild is in the cards this fall, so anything that accelerates wear of the rings, sleeves, etc is OK, since those are about to be replaced anyhow."

"Need advice on building a muscle car, odd request.
Not sure if this is the right sub, I will remove it not.  I will try to not be long winded here, but bear with me.
My dad was a big mechanic, he loved to rebuild muscle cars, he was the guy everyone came to when they had questions.  He worked on anything with an engine, and would love to work on big diesel machines, odd foreign cars, you name it.  I never really got to know him, I was very young when he died.  My mom told me last year that when I was born he always talked about how he couldn't wait to rebuild a car with me, it was all he talked about. Until last year I knew nothing about cars, I'm not sure if I could even change the oil if I had to.  I started working for a contractor and we do a lot of shop work on our cars, trucks, equipment, small motors, etc and I am finally gaining some experience.  I started buying broken cars about 3 months ago to work on and resell so I can learn more.
Now that I am starting to get some know how I would love to rebuild an old muscle car like my dad wanted me to.  I've been saving some money, and I have access to all the tools I would need luckily.  I need help though as this is something I will be going through slowly.  I really need advice on what car to buy since when I make that decision I can't go back.  I know my father owned a 69 nova from a picture, but really any muscle car would do.  I'm hoping for suggestions based on ease of finding parts, cost of being able to build it, how cool it will be, and honestly whatever else you can think of that would help me make my decision.  Please understand I am very new at this, and I'm going into this knowing it's over my head, but it's something I really want to do.
Update:  Hey everyone, thanks so much for the advice, it all helped a lot.  Although it's not the exact thing I was looking for, I was talking to my boss about different cars and I mentioned that some people on here recommended a C10 as a great starter.  He walks around our shop and pulls the tarp off two old c10s, and said I could have one.  So looks like I will rebuild that for experience, and sell it at the end then use that money to hopefully rebuild a nova like my dad had.  Thanks again."
"Previously decent shop messed up my truck and is charging me even though it has to be trailered away - should I fight this?
Hey guys,
I'm after some advice here. I'm in the UK and I have a 2004 diesel Land Rover Discovery 2. It has 150k on the clock, and it failed in MOT inspection on front lower ball joint boots being perished. This is totally expected for this car and this mileage. Problem is replacing these is a c*nt of a job. I asked them if they were sure that they could do this specific job and got quote from them, I tried to stress that I knew this was an unusually difficult jobs that many garages will not touch, and I wanted their assurances that they knew what they were getting into which they gave. In good faith, I put the car in with a quote of around £500 for the job. Later in the day they phoned me to say that their guys couldn't get the ball joints out and I asked if they had hammered them or used a press, they said they were hammering them - this instantly told me that they were bullshitting me when they said they knew what they were doing. They wanted to send it to a local specialist, and that specialist wanted £1000+ for the job and I put my foot down and said to just put it back together. They have done so but say that it shouldn't be driven because the ball joints are not fully seated now.
So they BS'd be about knowing how to do the job, bottled it half way through and now are asking me for £134 labour even though I will have to have it towed away. The only specialist that I absolutely trust is an hour away, and it will cost me a fair amount to get it delivered to them. I am not made of money, and by car has been towed and the job has been done I am not inclined to pay that £134 for work that has essentially made my car immobile.
So, should I fight this? Is this fair practice? If I should fight it, what would be the best way to go about it? These guys are not cowboys, but they bit off more than they could chew and expect to be compensated. They can't stop me taking the car.
I am a business owner and I have *never* charged a client for fucked up work, even when it has cost me thousands of pounds in losses.

"Winter tires and ''grooved'' concrete highway.
Hey guys,  
I just got my winter tires installed (Firestone Winterforce) on my City Golf '07 and on the road home from the shop, there's a section on the highway in concrete that is kinda ''grooved'', well it felt like I had no traction whatsoever and it was bumpy as hell even down to 100km/h and it was a clear day, no rain/snow.

"Auto shop owners and self employed mechanics - can I ask you a few question about the business side?
Hey guys,
A friend of mine is self employed mechanic, he's a master diagnostic tech and has worked at many main dealers and big firms for over 25 years. Let's call him ""W."" He's been trading by himself for two years now. There's nothing he can't fix and his knowledge and skill as a mechanic is tremendous, but he struggles with some business aspects that I don't think he anticipated. I'm also self employed and I offer advice where I can, but I wondered how some of you would deal with specific scenarios like this.
**1. Diagnostics take hours and hours on a piece of shit car and cost of diag comes close to or exceeds car's value.**
W usually won't charge the number of labor hours he's spent diagnosing the problem. He barely breaks even on jobs like this.
**2. Major repair work on a piece of shit that exceeds car's value.**
We had a Renault with a snapped timing belt, the head had to be taken off three times before it ran right. W can fix anything, but I get the feeling he doesn't know when to quit. Again, he won't charge full for the work he's done.
**3. Customer doesn't pay.**
W is very lax with payment and he gives his customers waaaaaay too much leeway on when they're going to pay. He has a lot of deadbeats who owe him and doesn't pursue the money because he doesn't like confrontation. He contracted for one company and let them rack up an eye watering 5 digit debt - because he kept listening to the owner's BS excuses and thought ""he's nice."" No one is nice enough not to pay *me* and I'd have broken this guy's legs by now, and that's after he's ignored multiple court orders to pay his creditors including W. 
**4. Estimated cost of job fall far short of actual cost.**
Say he gives an estimate and then realises that the part will cost three times more than he anticipated. He will usually just wipe off his margin on the parts and possibly his labor too to get the final cost close to his estimate, I've tried to explain that an estimate is not a quote. fears customer will go somewhere else.
**5. Job goes on way longer and gets more expensive as it goes.**
What do you tell the customer? What choices do you have in getting rid of a bad job you know won't pay?
There are a few more, but basically he seems to absolutely hates charging people money because he doesn't like to upset people. People keep bringing him absolute heaps that really should have gone to scrap and he knows he can fix it but he can't do it for a profit. He worries people will say he's no good if he turns work down, but he won't charge an amount he'll make money from if he does take the job. It's so rare for him to just get a simple fucking service with no problems in and make some cash, and he's always broke even though he works 7 days a week. I feel like he's being way too nice to his customers and he needs to realise he's not a charity. I just feel like he could be making a decent living if he had more business discipline.
I don't think I can do anything as he's over 40 and this is just who he is, but I'd be interested to hear what you guys would do in his shoes.
Sorry for the wall of text :)."
"Best Gloves for prolonged contact with diesel oil to use?

"Not a car guy, but this is the first time I'm skeptical over my mechanics diagnosis.
Hello there.  Last winter the heat in my car went.  Everything else seemed fine, thermostat read normal, drove fine. I decided to ride it out. It's getting cold again and so I brought the car (07 Nitro) in to get looked at. Diagnosis was that it had low coolant, the water pump was bad, and the serpentine belt was dinged up.  Not a word about something simple like the thermostat, or heat core.
If all that is true, how the hell did my car never read hot?  I am afraid 1) the guy is taking me for a ride because I don't know better and 2) I seriously damaged my car if this is indeed the issue.  I've been without heat almost a whole year, and never got an overheat.The heat gauge never exceeds the normal reading.  If I've been riding a hot car for a year, that *cannot* be a good sign for the longevity of the car.
What do you folks think?  Thank you.
Edit: Thanks folks. You are all so informative.  I haven't heard back yet, but your input was very, very helpful.  I really appreciate it.
Edit 2:  So I just got my car back.  I walk in and the guy is like ""hey, you know the heat still isn't that great."" Wonderful.  Why is that? He's not sure.  Said the water pump was all wet from leaking, and when he drained the radiator he only got about a gallon of coolant.  Said he thought that'd do the trick.  He showed me the water pump, which I mean, I have no idea.  So I ask what now.  He says give it a day and see if it heats up when it is cooler (it is unseasonably warm here today). If it's no good bring it back and they'll rip the dash apart looking for something. He didn't seem to like the prospect of doing this. Said the car was too new for it to be the heat core.
So I'm bummed and swipe my card and say thanks.  He seemed like a legit dude (it was a different guy) but did give a very shitty handshake haha.  ANYWAY.  I take it for a spin and...the heat seemed fine.  It might not be a 10/10, but when I brought it in it was 1/10 at best, so I guess it worked out?  Maybe Nitros just have shit heat?
Anyway, thank you all for the input! I really appreciate it!"

"GM Tech requesting assistance with a diagnosis. Any Daywoo Techs out there? 2014 Chevy Spark.
Hey guys, I'm working on a 2014 Chevy Spark/Daywoo Matis abomination, and I could use some opinions.  1.2L, RPO LLO, 28,000 miles.
Car came in for coolant consumption.  After finding no leaks, I performed a ""block check"" test, which indicated positive for a combustion leak into the cooling system.  Before teardown, I added UV dye to the cooling system, circulated it, and let it sit with a pressure tester to try to highlight any metal defects, (if any).  
I've torn the engine down, and I have dye residue in the cylinder 3 exhaust port with a washed piston.  Unfortunately, I am unable to find any point of failure.  The head gasket looks consistent across all cylinders, and I don't see any cracks or porosity in the head or block.  There is some coolant in the oil, but I'm not sure if some just got past the rings.  My service manager wants me to replace just the head, but I'm not convinced it's not a block issue.  This engine sucks to work on, and it's warranty, so I don't really want to tear it all apart again, if this fix doesn't work.

"Who should pay here?
Trying to get a mechanic to kind of chime in here, I really want to make sure I approach this correctly with my mechanic.
For the last year or so, my car has gone a few months working fine, then it suddenly stops working.
If you try to start it you can hear it cranking, but it never turns on once these issues start up.
Each time, when my mechanic ran the little computer diagnostic It turns out to be the cam shaft and crank shaft position sensors that need to be swapped out for new ones.
This happened 6 times within 2 years and my same mechanic that I’ve been going to for years,  “fixed” it each time, and a few weeks after he changed those parts, the same thing would happen again and this would go on and on every other month for the past year.
So it happened again recently and being tired of paying this guy to do the same thing he hasn’t fixed 6 times,  I had the mechanic give me his guarantee and word that he'd take care of it should anything happen again.
He promised and swore up and down that he would, in front of my mom, in front of my wife and his employees.
Well that was bullshit.
So the car stopped working again about 3 weeks ago, this is the 7th time, I call him up and tell him ""hey man, you said this is on you, you said you’d take care of me if it happened again.
So cool, he had the car picked up, checked it out again, put the same exact pieces that keep breaking back in (camshaft/crank shaft position sensors) and told me to go to his electrical guy up the road.
Fine.
So I take it there, obviously they don't find shit because he had done the temporary patch he always does, so they sent me on my way and said they can’t fix it if the issue isn’t occurring.
Last week, like clockwork, the car stops working again, I call my mechanic and he says take it to the electrical guy.
Cool, I get it towed over there, I tell them to fix whatever it is and to call my mechanic when done that he will take care of it all as he said he would because this is technically still the ""next time"" the issue happened. 
It takes them a week to fix, but they called me this morning saying it's fixed and to come get it , that the issue had to do with some wiring between the relay box and wherever that goes, total damage is $240 .
They also say that they called my mechanic but he told them to call me to pay for it, not him. Unbelievable.
At this point I go back and forth with the guy at the electrical place, not angry, this guy is not at fault, just wanted to get the details.
So now I call my mechanic, of course he isn't in yet for the day, but I'm waiting to just tell him either to pay that tab somehow, maybe scratch their back with a job and take care of it, I don't care, but he gave me his word and now I feel he's going back. 
So for this situation, who is right, who is wrong?
I feel in the interest of fair customer service, my mechanic should pick up the tab.
I know technically he said he’d take care of it, but this is out of his realm, however, given that he failed to fix this problem multiple times in the past, regardless this should be on him, that’s just good business, no?
Thoughts?"

Hey all, apparently this a pretty common problem for Outbacks and Legacies from 2010-12. Occasionally, it will have very low engine RPM when coming to a stop when the torque converter restricts the oil passage causing low lock-up pressure release.The local mechanic is quoting $3,000 for the fix.

I'm looking to buy a new set of Blizzaks for the winter and I am wondering if I need to provide a whole new set of rims if I plan on holding on to the original tires for the summer. In the past, they seem to just throw away my old tires without asking if I wanted to keep them...
I drive an 07 Toyota Camry and plan on getting the BLIZZAKWS80 215/60R16's. Thanks."

"2006 Scion TC - $2,600 USD for repairs?!!!
Hey all,
Got a quick question and looking for some feedback/advice. My 2006 Scion TC w/ 103,000 miles recently wouldn't turn on and the check engine light was on. I jump started the vehicle, and brought it to Toyota which is about 5 miles from my home. 
They called me up and let me know the following is wrong with the car:
* Needs catalytic converter - $1,100
* Needs battery, alternator, terminal cable - $900
* needs water pump and drive belt - $660
 
Now is it just me, or do those figures seem extremely high? I mean, even just for a battery, alternator and cable they want $900? I can find the battery new for about 160 online and the alternator for around the same price..whats going on here?
I'm also debating just selling the vehicle (I was offered $1,800 for it) as is and saving it. I live in a metropolitan area and mass transit (subway, zipcar, etc) is all readily available to me...any thoughts?
**Edit: 1 I have called the dealer and told them that I will be picking up the car either tomorrow or saturday. I will be taking it to a secondary shop (mom and pop place by me with a lot of really good reviews) for them to check it out and tell me whats wrong. At minimum I'll get a new battery I know I need one..the rest of the repairs are up for debate. I'll update again later. Thanks for the tips and info**
**Edit 2: I now have possession of the vehicle and purchased a new battery myself from autozone. I'll be replacing it sometime this week as I'm fairly busy with work. I'll be testing the alternator with a voltage meter and make a decision based on the reading as to my next course of action. My co-worker has a heated garage and some knowledge with repairs like this and he offered his help. I may just take it over to his place and swap out the alternator if it comes to pass that the alternator is in fact dead**"
"[Manual Transmission] How to drive during stop&go traffic on hill?
Hey guys,
I'm driving a 2001 Honda Civic LX that is a manual transmission. Now I'm wondering how are we supposed to drive a manual car in that terrible bumper to bumper stop and go traffic during rush hour, when on a hill?
Not rolling back into the car behind me is probably the biggest concern, but I also don't want to destroy my clutch. I've seen a couple of different Youtube videos where people do different things (regular shift from neutral to 1st just fast, hold clutch depressed just before biting point to shorten the clutch travel time to start again while in 1st, using parking brake, using clutch to hold on hill, etc) but not sure which one would actually be best?"

"White smoke and dipstick won't come out
Hey Guys, I am the ford dealership right now waiting to get my car towed here. I was on the highway and all of a sudden my engine shut off and I got a bunch of white smoke coming out the back. I got to am exit and got off which was nice. When I popped the hood to check the oil level I couldn't get the dipstick out. I pulled and pulled on it but it felt like it was bolted on there. Eventually I actually ripped the plastic handle off and now he dipstick is still stuck in there. 
Any idea of what happened? I got my oil changed at a jiffy lube yesterday and I'm thinking that they didn't tighten the oil filter completely but not sure. If it was just that would I just be able to tighten it up and top off the oil?"
"Activating the rear windshield wiper kills the engine
Hey everybody. I have a 2000 land rover discovery 2 and I've been having a very troubling and dangerous issue. Whenever I activate the rear windshield wiper, the engine immediately dies. It also refuses to start (it will turn over, but will not run or work on its own) if I leave the wiper on. I'm replacing the passenger compartment fuse box today for some corrosion and scorching on the board when the part arrives, but I'm not certain the two issues are related. I have never heard of this happening and want to try to get advice on where else to look for the source of the problem. The wiring up front looks A-okay and I'll be checking the wiring in the rear in a bit. 
UPDATE 1: I replaced the fusebox, and nothing changed. I also pulled the rear wiper motor and checked it with a multimeter and everything looks fine there as well. 
While checking the motor, I decided to leave it out and car would turn over but would not start. As soon as I reconnected the motor, the car started up just fine. This makes me think that perhaps it isn't something with the ignition system, but perhaps with the fuel supply somehow relying on the circuit in the wiper motor? Thoughts?
UPDATE 2: I just did a little digging in the wiring harness by tracing the wiring from the fuse box all the way back to the windshield wiper, and found nothing. All the wiring looks intact and there aren't any spots where they've been gnawed by rodents. My next step is going to be to drop the fuel tank and check the fuel pump for any shorts... I'm at a loss3
UPDATE 3: Figured it out! On the advice of /u/Lumpy2, I realized that the ignition circuit had a sneak ground circuit through the rear windshield wiper, and engaging the rear wiper cut this circuit, suggesting that the normal ignition circuit ground was not working properly. I checked that ground connector and found it unplugged... not sure if it was left that way by a previous tech or if it just rattled out on its own, but i plugged it back in and everything works like a charm."
"Changing the clutch on my 92 Accord, can't get the bell housing off.
Hey Reddit, I'm having trouble getting the bell housing off to reach the clutch in my Accord (It's a 92 so the CB7 generation). So far, I've disassembled the passenger side hub assembly, taken out all of the bolts (I think), disconnected the shifter linkages and speedo/reverse cables, and other miscellaneous things. I'm not sure if I need to disassemble the drivers side hub assembly too to get the other half shaft out, or if I'm missing something else entirely. Could it be the car is in gear? (I may have bumped it into gear when disconnecting the linkages). Or maybe we need to support the trans to pull it out since its hanging a bit. If you guys have any suggestions let me know!"
"Is it really bad to disconnect the battery on a running car; if so, why?
Hey Reddit, not trying to start an oil war here but hoping for some knowledgeable input to help resolve a stupid internet argument on another forum.
Simply put - searching the net will find numerous warnings that disconnecting the battery on a running engine (for diagnostic purposes or whatever) is a Bad Thing ^(tm), which could/will fry your regulator or diodes or ECM or what-have-you due to voltage surges/spikes/cosmic rays/etc.  
So, the question in two parts:  
A) is it actually bad (or used to be okay but not so much with these newfangled computerized gizmos, or used to be bad but isn't anymore for the same reasons), and:  
B) if so, what is the precise mechanism by which said badness may occur?

"200km into the bush, mushroom picking. Had to cut some corners, wondering what kind of damage I may have done to ol' bertha.
Hey guys, so I bought a 1993 Mazda MPV V6 and took it into the bush mushroom picking.  It has 170,000 KM.  I got out to the bush with it and the battery died.  So we drove it here and there over a week or two just charging the battery off another car.  Next time we came into town we came in on charged batteries and bought a new alternaator belt, as our old one looked like it may be the issue.  All worked fine for a while when we where in town, but on our way to the bush again on the highway it died.  this whole time it had seemed the alternator kind of half worked, except in town right after the belt changed, it seemed then all worked perfectly.  Then it died again on the highway after about 2.5 hours of driving, so we camped off the road.  I took the alternator out to take a look at it again.  Iv refurbished a few alternators and generator type devices, so i tried to take it apart.  In the process of that i cross threaded the bolt that holds the pully on, and basically totally fucked the alternator up, and it was unable to hold the pully.  So we figured, alright whatever, we will get a couple batteries charged, hump it to town and buy a new alternator, as this one had been sketchy for some time.  So anyways we are driving on the highway and my girlfriend notices alot of smoke coming from the exaust, and the check engine light comes on.  We where kindof in the middle of nowhere and there was nothing we could have done, it would have been a bad idea to stop where we where, so we kept driving until after about 5 mins, over about 15 seconds the entire car got engulfed in ""smoke"" and a giant cloud of smoke(like alot of smoke).  So we stopped the car, got out and booked it 20 meters away expecting a fireworks show.  But it calmed down and after opening the hood i realised that the fan simply wasnt spinning and the engine was over heating bad and the smoke was just boiled antifreeze/water.  So basically we parked the vehicle in a safe spot and hitchhiked to the nearest biggest town(terrace,bc), and we have gotten a new alternator.  The main question I have is what possibilities of things may I have messed up through putting the car through this stuff.  Id like to spend a couple days making sure it runs good and iv fixed everything before heading back into the bush.  Thanks so much guys."

"I had my head gasket replaced and now my car stalls when the RPMs drop [VW Golf MK4 2001]
   Hey, 2 days ago I picked up my car from a good shop in our town after getting my head gasket replaced, they also replaced my oil filter and the oil.
   I came to a stop at an intersection and as my RPMs dropped to idle the engine died. Started it again, drove some more, came to a stop again but the engine didn't die, it just kinda stuttered as the RPMs dropped to idle, I took off in first and when I pressed the clutch to shift into second the engine died again, I accidentally started it as I let out the clutch.
Started the car again, drove home somehow, as I pulled into my parking lot and pressed the clutch and the brake the car died again, since then I didn't start it again.
Now, do you think this is related to the head gasket job or is it a pure coincidence ? And what could cause the issue I'm trying to describe ? And if anyone knows at what price I'm looking as I'm not exactly rolling in money being in college and all.

"2005 Ford Focus trunk issue
Hey guys, really appreciate this sub being here, bunch of life savers!
As I''m sure you all know, the Ford Focus is notorious for having defect after defect whether its electronics or other things.
Well, the day has finally come where the boot of my 2005 Ford Focus SE 4 door sedan has shit the bed with the trunk.
I have tried all I can think of. The key doesn't release the trunk lock mechanism, the key fob doesn't work, the trunk button on the console near the steering wheel doesn't work.
I have also taken the liberty of trying to get the rear back rests down but the release is, of course, in the trunk.
My BF has gone as far as to take the interior plastic paneling off around the back rest to try and get an arm in behind the seat to release the cable but the size of the hole to get back there is too small. We can't dismantle the back rest from the frame of the car either because my BF doesn't have an impact wrench/drill /or whatever is necessary to get the bolts out.
Any help is really appreciated and we're out of ideas but we can't afford the cost of getting it repaired right now. 
The reason it's important we get the trunk open is because our friends only set of keys is in there right now after a night of partying for his graduation, ha ha ha. 
Thanks in advance for all your help guys, really appreciate it.
TL:DR: Can't get the trunk open with key, fob, or button, or by attempting to remove interior moldings. Our friend's only set of keys are back there so it's important that we get them out for him, but we can't afford a mechanic right now. Any DIY suggestions?"
"Felt like sharing, O2 sensors are fun!
Hey there, not sure if this is allowed, let me know but I think it's okay. 
 
A bit of backstory. Bought my 2002 Toyota Corolla S used, 120k miles, when I got my DL. Always been the type to do it myself if I can. I've replaced oil filters, ignition coils and spark plugs, window motors, completely redid my headliner, bled my brakes several times (still want them tighter) etc etc, most of them due to check engine lights. I get a check engine at least once a year, yay for used 12 year old cars!
My most recent engine light, after heading to both autozone and o'riley auto parts to get two readings, was evidently caused by messed up O2 sensor, downstream. (this was sort of ""confirmed"" by the fact that I couldn't find time to replace them for a month or so, and it guzzled gas like crazy) So off I go, buying two new oxygen sensors (why not replace both up and down, they haven't been touched since the previous owners probably) and getting prepared. The upstream was easy. Bend over the engine bay, unscrew the two screws, take new oxygen sensor and oxygen sensor gasket and replace. The second took me awhile. I tried browsing around, reading through the DIY manual for my car, etc. The only useful piece of information I had was that the connector was under the front passenger seat. 
And so I spent six hours tearing apart the area. And then I replaced everything, because it wasn't where I thought it would be. And then I went back to the book, and noticed I needed to take it apart again. So I did, and I finally found it! Ive never been so relieved. Now to plug the new one in and see if my engine light persists.
Part of me wonders if it was worth the effort...
http://imgur.com/kc4qmP3
EDIT: Many of you have mentioned that O2 sensor replacement is a commonly given response by most auto stores, and I am aware of that. This way I can eliminate the O2 sensors from the equation, and they have never been touched in 160k miles so I felt it was a good time to replace them anyways. Thanks for all the advice, though, I'll keep an eye on my emissions as that may be the culprit."

"Ford vs. Ford advice
Hey there,  
  
I've got a painfully limited money situation but need a vehicle short term that can handle mountain roads and haul gear. Between friends and family, I've got two options on my hand:  
  
Option 1: 1985 Ford F-150. Beautiful truck, maintained, but needs a brake line repair, so it'll have to be towed to a shop upon buying. Has LITERALLY only been driven back and forth to church on Sunday's by my friend, a pastor, who I don't think would lie about it. It's got 156K on it, with under 40K on the trans. He's selling it to me for $400, otherwise it's going to the crusher.   
  
Option 2: 2001 Ford Explorer. Rough around the edges, not sure how well it's been maintained. It has a grinding sound in the back rear tire that reminds me of when my wheel bearing went bad on my old Subaru. It needs a new starter, but that will be fixed at sale. 225K miles on it, but they were planning on donating it so they're wanting to give it to me for free.  
  
Assuming I have a bit over $1000 to put towards the vehicle's immediate maintenance and repairs, which one is the better option? Is either one easier to work on, or will they both be hard to find parts for? What should I be looking out for besides blown heads that might be an immediate problem?  
  
UPDATE: Looks like most everyone here supports the F-150! Bad news bears is that it looks like it's developing a head gasket leak. So, for the time being, Explorer it is. Thank you all for the advice and education!"

"2005 Honda CR-V making squeaking sound from rear driver's side wheel when turning right after bottoming out hard.
Hey everyone, I am currently on a road trip with a friend in Colorado. My friend and I are from Minnesota and while driving on some particularly gnarly roads here in Colorado encountered an unexpected hole that made the car bottom out quite hard. The car hit hard enough to dent the tubular steel protecting the gas tank and to break a honeycomb looking structure near the rear driver's side wheel. Afterwards, the car leaked brittle black sprinkle looking things. Additionally the car now makes a squeaking sound from the rear driver/left wheel when turning to the right. Since we were far from the city or reception we had no choice but to keep driving the car. The car has since stopped losing black sprinkles but the squeaking sound persists. The sound only happens when turning right and aside from the squeaking the car runs like a champ.  We are in small mountain towns in Colorado not near a mechanic and wondering what the sound could possibly be. We are wondering what the sound is and whether or not it would be okay to drive home to our usual mechanic in Minnesota or if we should stop in a bigger city such as Denver and get it checked out/fixed.
Below is an album with photos of the underside of the car including the gas tank and the honeycomb looking thing as well as photos of the sprinkles that leaked out.

"1996 Mazda Miata: Can an '94 engine be made to work in a '96 car?
Hey guys, first off, I appreciate any and all help.
I bought a '96 Miata with a blown engine (cracked block). I bought a 1996 Miata crate engine, swapped it in, and kept getting a CEL for the Crankshaft Position Sensor. After hours of replacing parts and confusion, I figure out there are no nubs for the CPS to get that magnetic read from...and so it's a 1995 engine, at best. Call the junkyard, it's in fact a '94. ""Our book said it was the same thing."" I'm llvid, understandably, I hope. Junkyard will not pay for engine and swap out, what I want (yes, I know I could sue). But, they will pay, depending on cost, for a fix of sorts. Can the engine be modified - harmonic balancer replaced, maybe, to get it to play nice with a CPS? And how costly is it? Furthermore, even if it can, I'm not entirely sure it will pass in Rhode Island - where I am - because I'm not clear on whether an old engine in  a new car doesn't pass because of OBD sensors (and can be fixed, like this) or if RI doesn't allow old engines in new cars, at all (like CA). Finally, how would I go about phrasing all of this to a mechanic over the phone or in an email to get a quote?
TL;DR:
1. 94 engine in 96 car - Crankshaft Position Sensor cannot work.
2. Can it be fixed? For how much?
3. (Bonus) Would it pass in RI?
Please don't tell me to just sell the car - that's an option, for sure, but not the question.
Willing to guild for complete answers, need the help!
Thank you so much guys, I'm clearly over my head in this. 
Cheers!"
"Problems with the engine (?) of a '99 VW Golf Mk IV
Hey everyone! :D
So, let's get straight to the point. There is a Mk IV Golf, built in 1999, 1.6 petrol and it is a rather lovely ""Generation"" Special Edition in a really cool color with lots of nice details.
It recently passed 130k Kilometers and while it is still a car I absolutely adore (even though it doesn't belong to me, but someone near to me) it recently didn't pass the TÜV as we call it in Germany (I think the UK-equivalent would be MOT, but I have no idea how you call it in the US...It is some sort of legally-mandated test cars have to pass).
The things that are really broken can be repaired, but there is the question whether the money should be invested or spent on something new.
And there is one thing which has been bothering me constantly. The actual owner of the car says that it ain't a problem unless the car breaks down, but I want to make sure it isn't a bad sign which will lead to more problems in the future. I think it is the same overall problem, which appears in 3 different situations.
1. When starting the car, the engine revs uncontrollably. Not very high, from ~ 500-1500rpm. It just goes up and down a few times before settling at a normal point.
Also, when the headlights are on during that period, they start flickering.
2. It is horrible to get off the clutch and start driving. I've driven quite a number of different cars and for getting started in this Golf you basically need magic powers. Last time I drove it, I killed it 5 times before I finally could drive normally. In any other car, it doesn't happen to me at all nowadays (Even though it also happended quite a few times during driving lessons, lol xD)
3. When I'm driving and press the gas pedal just a single, short time (Just one tap with my foot) it reacts...strange. After noticing it for the first time, I tried that in other cars and all others react like I think they should: They just push forward a bit. But the Golf just makes a really strange, strong hop, that happens with a barely noticeable delay. It is really weird. Tap the pedal --> Very, very, very short (But noticeable) delay --> Strong hop forwards.
So, those are the 3 problems. I think they might have the same reason, but I don't know much about Mechanics...
I hope someone here can help me :D

Hey guys, I bought a used 2013 Scion FRS from a used car dealership back in January of this year and about 6 and a half weeks ago now I had to take it in to a Toyota dealership because upon starting the car, there was a loud engine knocking noise which resulted in it being the engine rod #3 being bent. (Picture below)
https://imgur.com/ZJxzfek
Toyota has given me many different excuses of why they don't want to cover it such as ""it's not a factory defect"" and them blaming the previous owner of the vehicle for this happening. 
About a year ago, the engine had to be repaired while under the previous owner and they replaced the short block along with other things (picture from the CarFax below)
https://imgur.com/R35rI3k
I've been talking to someone here on reddit about this issue and he is telling me that in order for the rod to bend like that, it had to be caused by hydro lock. He is telling me that when the short block os replaced, the old head gaskets are joined with the new short block and he suspects that that is the reason this happened to my engine.
Just want to confirm if this os a possibility? As stated, I just bought the car in January (with 39k miles) and this just happened early June (49k miles). At first they were trying to say I put e85 fuel in the engine (because apparently the previous owner did that and messed something else up on the car because of it) but thy ran tests on my fuel and showed I only ran 91 octane. I have never put any different type of fuel in the car nor have I tuned the car in any way. It's just the way I purchased it.
Trying to find some help since I did pay for an extended warranty who told me they would cover it but only if my car was no longer under the Toyota Powertrain warranty and the inspector that looked at my car and asked for the tests to be run said that Toyota should be the one covering it and there should be no reason why they wouldn't be covering it since all tests show that I did not cause this but Toyota still won't budge.
It's been about 6 and a half weeks now and I haven't even been given a loaner car. I work full-time and also go to college and it's getting so hard to get to both places. Thanks for the help!"

Since I have very little experience, I am a little concerned about completing this project but I think this is the best way to learn and I know there is a ton of documentation and experience with this car and engine combo in America so I am not too too worried. 
My main questions are as follows:
**I intend to buy the engine in probably not the best condition since I intend to rebuild it but I want to know what would constitute a no go.** It sounds like something like a blown head gasket may be fine and fixed during the rebuild but more serious problems may make engine unusable. For example, is it ok to buy an engine that has lost compression in some cylinders. I would assume its ok and this would likely be fixed in the rebuild but I just have so little experience I don't know what all can be fixed in a rebuild and what can't be.
**Does it matter if the engine doesn't have any problems at all or is it a big waste of money to rebuild a engine in ""good"" condition (I feel like you can never tell with these imports)?** I was actually hoping I could save a penny by rebuilding a not so perfect engine.
**Should I buy just the long block to rebuild and then the turbos, manifolds, transmission, etc after or should I attempt to buy it all together and then take it all apart and rebuild the long block then?**
**Aside from videos and threads online, the full service manual for the s13 and the sr20DET, are there any other resources I should be aware of to help complete this project?**
**Is there a good way to know confidently that the engine is in good working condition outside of the car before the swap?** I am worried that I may mess up the swap and think the engine rebuild is wrong or mess up the engine rebuild and think the swap is wrong. Since I am a complete noob, I want to reduce the amount of variables as much as possible for a large project like this and knowing that the engine works before the swap would help a lot.
Any specific advice or tools I should know of for this specific swap (SR20DET in an S13).
In general, any advice for someone with basically zero experience for a project like this? I know it is probably better to start on a smaller scale but that is not my style and I like a trial by fire to see if I can pull this off. Thanks for any and all help."

"Just had a bunch of service done on my car and about 20 miles out of the shop i had an issue...
Hey guys! My mechanic had my 2010 Subaru Impreza 2.5i (137k miles) for the past 10 days. I had an oil leak (remilled+ rear pan) and while he was doing that he did the timing belt, water pump, spark plugs, oil change, etc. I'm all up on maintenance. Cost just under $3000.
I picked it up yesterday and drove it home (1 mile). I packed up the car to go on vacation and about 10/15 miles out on the highway, something came off the front of my car (about an inch of rubber it looked like) and bounced off my windshield. I was concerned, but I calmed myself down thinking maybe it came off the car in front of me or off the road (I really REALLY didn't want to believe something was wrong). About a minutes later it happened again (definitely came off my car) and about 30 seconds later there is smoke trailing my car.
I pull over and there is oil dripping fast under my car. Since I was close to home and wanted to get back without calling a tow truck, I turned around and got back home.
My mechanic is closed until July 5th because of the holiday and I have a few questions if you're willing to provide some possible answers...
1.) Any guesses to what that rubber thing was?
2.) Is this something that my mechanic will usually fix free of charge or is that an unlikely scenario?
3.) I don't have a third question... I just want a hug.
Thanks guys."

"'13 Subaru Outback transmission lag
Hey folks. First time posting here and I thought I'd see if there is anyway to fix my issue. I almost got in an accident in my 2013 Subaru Outback AWD because I was at a stop sign and was trying to get across quickly. I slammed down the gas and my car lagged for about 2-3 seconds then took off causing me to have a close call. I believe this is from it having a CVT trans. Is there anyway to bypass this lag that happens? It seems very dangerous for my vehicle to not go quickly from a stand still when I need it to. Manual mode? Any suggestions are welcomed.

"When do you call it quits on fixing an older car?
Hey all,
Usually I hang around /r/cartalk but thought I'd ask the question here. I was curious as to when one should retire an older car? E.g. I bought my Ford for AUD$3000 and have spent about the same fixing stuff over the 4yrs I've had it. However, it is basically new under bonnet (excluding engine) and runs like a dream. Many people kept telling me after I spent $2000 to retire it and get something new - but a similar priced car I thought would just end up having many of the same issues I had fixed - and alot is just old age (1996 model) like rear suspension, tyres, exhaust, ball joints etc. I've recently replaced my coil and distributor and soon my power steering pump and high pressure hose (a common issue with el falcons). So, in your opinions, would it have been better to have retired the car? Or am I just prolonging the inevitable (some sort of engine failure)?
More to the point - when is it worth fixing and when is it worth flipping?"
"99 Tacoma. 2 Hi works, 4 Lo works, nothing happens when I shift into 4 Hi.
Hey friends!  Looking for some guidance here.  I recently picked up a 99 Tacoma with 160k miles for a great price.  I knew when I got it that 4Hi did not work, but I live in Charlotte, North Carolina, so I can probably get by without it.  However, the purpose of having it on the vehicle is so that you can use it if needed, so I'd like to fix it.
The 4x4 mechanism is another stick that goes down into the transfer case right behind my gear lever (straight drive).
The 4x4 light comes on when I engage 4 low, but nothing happens when I engage 4 high.
The guy I bought it from thinks it is an electrical problem inside the transfer case.
Another friend also said that it would be inside the transfer case.  
What are my best options?  Is there a likely problem inside the transfer case that can be fixed?  Would it be cheaper and easier to just get another transfer case?
Thank you kindly for the advice.  Price is a concern... but I'm willing to pay to have the vehicle working as intended."

Hey r/MechanicAdvice! 
I am an adept Automotive Technician halfway through a skilled trade program I bought from an online college. I am 24 years old, and have been wrenching for 7 years. I'm addicted to fixing cars, I have been freelancing auto repairs off of craigslist for a little over a year. My only major shop experience was installing Compressed Natural Gas in modern cars for about 5 months, sadly the company died, and I had to move on for financial reasons. I'm least experienced with internal engine repair, I'm most experienced with general maintenance. I am aiming to be ASE certified, I love everything but Body work.  
I've been at home with my daughter, working on my schoolwork and doing the freelance thing, until recently my roomie quit their job and has been totally inactive since. I've been making $400 a mo babysitting for a friend, so now the roomie can watch the boys, while I  try to find work.

"2009 Subaru Forester XT having cold start issues
Hey guys. 
My '09 FXT has always had something against starting up in the winter, but this year it's finally come to a point where I feel I should do something about it - probably because it cranked until I killed the battery a couple weeks ago and I needed to bum a ride off a friend. It later started with a jump fine. It was only -10C then. It will always start when the block heater is plugged in, and once it's warmed up it starts up like it's summer. Only time it won't is after sitting for multiple hours in the cold. I don't have anywhere to plug it in at work, and it's getting much colder now so I'd really like to solve this issue. I took a video after sitting for 4 hours in -18C so you can hear how it cranks yourself:
https://youtu.be/obGtfiKgYLc
Other info: I charged the battery overnight after I killed it, which has at least given me more wiggle room as to how long I can leave it and let it crank. Spark plugs were last done 50,000km ago, which is next on my list of things to try. Oil is fresh and synthetic. Replaced the starter a couple days ago which was worn and cranking slowly, this might have helped but did not solve the difficult starts - it starts up much nicer when it's warm now though. Once the car starts it has no stalling problems, it runs like new which makes me think it's ignition, not fuel but I could be wrong. When I replaced the starter I noticed one side of the TMIC's air ducts had been leaking (not attached right last the dealer worked on it I suppose) and had oil inside it - not a good sign, I presume? I don't know if it's related to the starts though. Air filter is brand new.
Any input is appreciated. Thank you!"

"Should I use Seafoam?

"1984 Diesel Rabbit, very low compression, no start.
Hey all,
I've got a Kubvan, a very rare vehicle, but it uses the same engine as a 1984 1.6L NA Diesel VW Rabbit.  I had a really nasty overheat a while back when my alternator/water pump belt snapped on the freeway (Without any squeaking or other warning!).  After I towed it home I found coolant in the oil, so I pulled the head, got it machined, installed it with a new gasket and new head bolts.  Everything is torqued to spec.  Got everything in time and reinstalled the timing belt.  Turned it over by hand a few times to make sure nothing was catching.  Tried to start it up and the engine turns but I get zero combustion.  I went out a got a compression tester and cylinders 3 and 4 were only getting ~130lbs.
So, is there anything I can check before I pull it apart again and check the pistons and rings?  I would have checked before but the machinist said since the head was still in relatively good shape it was very unlikely there was any serious damage done in the lower block.  Where else could I be losing compression?
If none of that works out can anyone recommend a shop in the SF bay area?  Ideally the north or east bay.
Out in CA so it never gets very cold.  Battery is good.  Starter seems to be good.  Fuel and Injection pump are good.  Glow plugs are good.

Hey guys, 
Brother in Law has a 99 Dakota with the 3.9. The other day it wasn't starting, when I swung by (live near one another) when he would crank it, the starter sounded like it would freespin almost. 
Off the cuff, I said to get your electrical system checked, then the starter, and we can go from there. They pulled the battery, took it to O'Reilly's got it charged, re-installed, then connected it to my sister in law's car to let it charge a few minutes more. 
When he went to start it, the starter still spun really quick, but now the horn was honking by itself, the lights and radio were flicking on and off, everything made loud clicking noises. My sister in law was in the garage attic when it happened and she said it sounded like a bomb. 
Now nothing works. 
He removed the cables and cranked the truck and it started going crazy again. So they haven't tried since.

"1996 Toyota Camry cranks but won't start.
Hey everyone, Before I start I just want to say I apologize if I sound dumb saying any of this I don't know much about my car and repairs for it besides what I have learned from Youtube and the internet.
Ok, so about two weeks ago I was driving my 1996 Toyota Camry to work in a bad rain storm and as I was driving up a hill my car suddenly lost acceleration and started rolling backwards so I stopped the car and shut it off and tried to turn it back on but it only cranked and wouldn't start. 
My Dad looked at it and suggested I change the Distributor and I did but it didn't fix anything so after some research on my own I checked the timing belt and from the top it looks like it is completely off the pulley (Or whatever it is called) that It's suppose to be on. So basically I have a ton of questions.
1. I know It is hard to diagnose just from what I wrote but is just the timing belt my issue? Or could it be something else too?
2. My local mechanic gave me a quote but just said they would just be replacing the belt and from what I watched online it seems that the tensioner and some other stuff should be changed before a new belt gets put on is it fine for me just to get a new belt? Or is it necessary to get all the other stuff?
3. Is a timing belt something I should try to change myself? Or is it best left to the pro's? I honestly don't have the kind of money my local shop wants for the job but I do have enough to buy the parts and couple of tools I need to attempt it myself.
I hope I provided enough info about the problem if you need any more details I will do my best to provide them. Thank you in advance for any and all replies and advice!"

"Hit bump and screwed up my oil pan. Spoke to my mechanic who said he can work on it tomorrow. My oil has leaked out already...My mechanic is barely a mile away, if I pour in a pint of oil, will that at least allow me to reach my mechanic without worry?
I hit a bump at a fairly slow speed (under 15) but the drop was pretty bad. The car was leaking oil but not all of it immediately.
I hit the bump, immediately get out to check out the damage. Tires were fine, muffler is possibly screwed up (car is significantly louder now, but i'm far more worried about oil then noise of course.) and didn't notice a leak.
Drove for about 5 minutes to get to an ATM, and figured while i'm out, i'll check again. And that's when I noticed the dripping.
My mechanic was between that location, and my house, so I stopped by there first. He didn't have a lot of time to look at it, told me to pick up an ""oil sending unit"" and come back tomorrow. (He is aware I don't live far from him.) but to avoid driving around much more then that.
I get home, about 6 hours later I decide to check my oil. The spot under my car is somewhat dry (it's also a gravel driveway, so it's very hard to tell how soaked/dry it really is.)
and my oil is basically empty.
My question is; since I know I should NOT drive without oil, if I were to pick up a bottle of oil and put it in, would that at least last me long enough to get it the mile or so to the mechanic?
I'm not sure how worried I should be about all of this, on one hand it's just a mile, on the other hand, that could be more then enough driving to completely fuck my engine over.
I just need to get it roughly a mile, I don't know if oil going in will immediately completely leak out, or if just enough will remain to lubricate the engine for that short ride.
Update: After posting this last night and asking a buddy on facebook, my buddy decided to randomly show up an hour later at 3am. (Later to figure out he showed up because his girlfriend was driving without a license and a cop was tailing them. ""Hey, From_my_iPhone is still awake and right here. We'll just go pay them a visit so the cop'll fuck off."")
He took a moment to check out the damage for me.
Oil pan is fine. The oil pan cap had become loosened just enough to drip oil.
(It also occurs to me that I may have mislead some people here, my mechanic wasn't the one who said it was the oil pan. He said it was most likely the Oil sending unit after a quick glance at it, since he was extremely short on time yesterday. My apparently idiot friend was the one who got under it and said it was the oil pan.)
We put some oil in it, watched it for awhile. There were no drips, but he agreed with the mechanic, oil sending unit most likely needs to be replaced.
We put 2 quarts of oil in it, and took it down to the mechanic.
And yep...oil sending unit. I guess it had gotten dislodged and fucked up and was just dripping oil that was leaking down the side of the pan and looked far worse then it was.
$40 for putting in the new oil sending unit, $11 for the part itself, and he cleaned a lot of the mess with some engine degreaser and a hose.
I appreciate all the advice, I suppose I worry more then I should. But when your broke and behind on bills, the last thing you want to do is fuck up your ride."
"Brake lights not coming on, new bulbs, new fuse
Hey there:
I have a 2004 Pontiac Montana, just normal base version.  It has three brake lights: two in the actual tail light housing, and one up on top of the rear hatch.
Not sure if both tail light brake lights blew at the same time or separately, but as of right now, neither tail light brake light is lighting up, but the one on top of the rear hatch is lighting up.
Put in brand-new bulbs in both tail light housings, and put in a brand new fuse in the fuse box, but still, neither brake light in the tail light housings is lighting up (although the top one is still fine).
I only know where one fuse box in my car is, and it's mounted right in the side of the dashboard as you open the passenger side door. I replaced the fuse called ""stop lamp"".
So now I'm very stuck.  If not the fuse and not the bulbs.... what could it be?
Thank you everyone!!
EDIT:  maybe should add that all other lights in both housings appear to work. thank you!  :)"
"Oil Change, Now Chaos
Hey guys, I own a series 2 VX Commodore with a Series 2 3800. It is dual fuel.
I bought it about 6 months ago with 297000 or so KM on the clock, drove it around a little, fixed a few issues (torn intake boot, etc etc.) And got to about 300000km. I changed the oil in the car with penrite Gas 10 (10W-50, semi synthetic for LPG engines), used the correct amount (5l, full fill is 4.8l with filter), all seemed well.
About a month or two later with ~1500KM more on the clock, the engine began to behave really erratically (fine on startup, rough as guts after 5 minutes etc. Etc.), ended up getting extremely bad so I decided to pull the oil pressure switch during diag and noticed with the oil pressure switch disconnected the low oil pressure light DID NOT come on on the dash. Decided to go buy a new filter and stick it on the car for the sake of it, changed the filter and the engine oil is black, worse than what I'd expect from a diesel that's done 10k km, along with the oil came chunks of bearing material and little chunks of sludge (mind you, this is from after the oil pump).
Just wondering what you guys think about this, have not cut the filter apart, unsure why this has happened (car ran fine a few weeks ago and has been serviced to proper intervals if the window sticker is to be believed).
Really just want some feedback, maybe I've done something wrong, maybe not. I've not been overly hard on the car since I owned it and the oil looks like it's gone double it's service interval or more after 1500km. 
Tl;dr: oil change seems to have broken car, confused if it's my fault or not
Edit: I use penrite oil (HPR5) in my other cars(3.6L HFV6) and they seem to do very well on it. Filter used was a Ryco. Really not sure what to do as the car feels like it might be up for an engine (engine vibrates pretty roughly).
Edit 2: I should mention the oil pressure switch signal should go directly to the PCM (not through any connectors), and I believe the PCM triggers the light on the cluster through the data bus, there is no input on the cluster for the oil pressure switch)"
"Drum to Disc conversion question
Hey guys, I have a 85 Citation X-11 and it has come time to service the rear drum brakes.  I was thinking to myself, ""why don't I just convert them to discs?""
[Edit] Chevy Citation
So I went on summit and found general rear drum to disc kits, but I was wondering how they were actually attached to the car?  I saw a time-lapse video of someone installing them on a Dodge truck, and it looked like from the video the two plates pinched together on the flange where the backing plate used to be instead of bolting directly to the axle.  Is this true or did I miss something?  Also, (if it is true) how likely would it be to slip under braking?  Thanks everyone."
"Need to clean a LIFETIME’S worth of tools.
Hey guys. Unfortunately, my former mechanic father recently passed away. It’s my duty and privilege to clean, organize and make sense of our 3 bay home garage literally filled to the rafters with tools.
Ive watched a few youtube videos and have a general idea of what to do, but I was wanting to know if there is some  “secret sauce” or method to cleaning lots of tools quickly and efficiently. And once clean, whats the best way to protect and store them for future generations to use and enjoy?
Thank you all for any input you may have. "

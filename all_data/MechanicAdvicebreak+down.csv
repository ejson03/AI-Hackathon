"DING DING DING! We have a repaired 99 GMC Suburban Vortec after 18 months, 4 shops...REPAIRED!
I kid you not.  The Suburban was on a flatbed trailer being taken to the Rescue Mission for a donation.  3 shops.  Nobody would, or could fix this baby.
Several shops would not even attempt.   In fact, one shop was so rude I left that clown a very nice Google Review for all to read!
History:  June of 2017 a complete top-end installed by shop 1.  Ran like a scalded ape for 1500 miles.  Pulling a moderate hill with a 38ft Airstream behind it, the Suburban was pulling hard, in probably 3rd, at about 50ish,
Out of the blue it began to break up. Backfire out the exhaust, bog down backfire into the intake and more.   So we turned it all around nursed it all back to town.
Shop 1 worked on it for weeks.  Finally in late Oct 2017 while it would run, you did not want to step too deep into the throttle or it will break up again.
Off and on through 2018, it was in and out of Shop 1 trying to figure this out.  Shop 2 began the part swap routine.  After replacing EVERYTHING--multiple times, it still ran like crap.
Shop 3 could not figure it out.
Shop 1 swapped the computer out.  By January 2019 the Suburban would hardly even move.  Popping backfiring, it acted as if it was on 1 cylinder.
I gave up.  We hauled it up on a flatbed to donate it to charity. 3 doors west of the Rescue Mission is a shop.  A very good shop. With Vipers, AMG's and other Suburbans in their ""repaired"" holding lot.  I spoke to the owner.  He at first was like everyone one else. Hesitant.  Too many hours to diagnose what the previously mentioned 3 shops have repaired.  Since EVERYTHING was replaced multiple times from fuel pumps to injection systems to distributors to computers, there was NOTHING ELSE...but lug nuts and diff oil....
He has a tech, a young guy who was in the office.  He told the boss he wanted that Suburban.  He could fix it!  I sat in the chair thinking, kid you are dumber than a sack of sand.  3 previous shops???  Yet you think you know what is wrong?
Boss looked at me.  ""He thinks he can fix it.""   OK, so we backed up the flatbed, it chugged off the trailer to a bay.  I left thinking this was an act of futility but let the little one try,
24 hours later I get a call.  It's fixed!  It's running.  It hauls ass and has been out on the highway for 2 hours running like it did in 2017.
Wrong?  Distributor plug was damaged by someone in the past by shoving it on and off multiple times.  Cap was all burnt up.  #8 wire was burned at the plug and the plug was fouled.
Delco Remy parts installed--Autozone--et al--removed---$1389- later, the GMC is running. ANd running good!
They did notice something, since having the front end rebuilt by shop 1 in 2017, it always pulled to the right. I thought it was out of alignment.
No, the upper control arm was the wrong one causing it to pull.  It was fixed also. 
Not to degrade the other shops 1,2,3.  But I will not bring my lawnmowers to them.  One gets what they pay for.  And I left a good Google review, where I noticed they had 184 FIVE Stars,,,,"
"Best way to slow down in a manual?
I've got three main methods of slowing down,
1. Put it in neutral and use the brakes
2. Engine braking until I get to about 2nd or 3rd and then using the breaks depending on if I need to come to a full stop or not.
3. If I'm going for a rolling turn, like at a no stop intersection or a green light, I select 3rd and either keep the clutch in til I need to accelerate or heel and toe.
I'm aware it's mostly up to driver preference but I want to know if any one method is healthier for my car. Thanks in advance!"
"Did any of you go from really quite useless trainees/apprentices and turn out to be really quite decent mechanics?
So I'm a first year HGV mechanic and I L-O-V-E this job, honestly so happy I found it. 
Thing is though, I can be a bit useless at times. Don't get me wrong I put in the hours (60 hour work week anyone?) and study hard for college but I'm impatient, clumsy, and hot tempered and pretty shit at working stuff out on my own plus o break stuff alot. 
Now I know I'm a first year apprentice and yes, we all make mistakes but it gets me down, especially when the older, qualified mechanics make back handed comments. 
I'm confident I'll get through my apprenticeship but I don't want to be a bad or average mechanic, I want to be a great mechanic, progress to master tech one day etc. 
Was this ever the case with any of you or did you must of you have a 'natural knack' for it or are naturally mechanically minded?
Edit: Thanks for all the advice and stories. It's been a great read and I've really appreciated each and every response! Happy spannering!"
"IAMA professional General Motors technician who has worked at a dealership for 8 years. I would like to clear up some misconceptions from my point of view. Feel free to ask any questions you may have.
The reason for this post is I have a hard time with everyone's mistrust of the automotive repair industry, and negative connotations involved with auto repair.  I am an ASE certified Master Automotive Technician, with a certification in Advanced Level Diagnostics.  I have successfully completed: 9 base ASE tests, 1 Advanced level diagnostics test, and well over 400 hours of General Motors specific training.  (Online, virtual classroom, and Hands-On)  Side note:  I'm not sure if I need to provide proof in this format, but I definitely will if requested by the mods.  Below are some common concerns I deal with on almost a daily basis by customers.
Oil Change Intervals:
This is always a giant can of worms.  In my professional opinion, from seeing many vehicles that have been pushed to the far limits of oil life capabilities to seeing vehicles that follow a more strict oil change intervals, changing your oil between 3000-5000 miles will almost always make your vehicle last longer.  That being said, someone will always have a ""My grandpa's cousin's wife's uncle never changed his oil under 10,000 miles and his truck lasted forever.""  or ""Oil technology has improved so much in the last 20 years, that interval no longer applies.""  Here is the main point to consider.  Your engine oil removes a copious amount of carbon and soot from your engine.  If these elements are not removed, they build up, and cause sludge.  Also, cleaning additives are integrated into engine oil and they break down over time/mileage, causing them to be less effective.  The true fact is, there are 1,000 factors that suggest when your oil change is most needed, but a ""rule of thumb"" should be 3,000-5,000mi.  (Regardless of what your ""Oil life indicator"" says it is.)  I've had many recalls in which we program the oil life indicator to go off sooner, as to prevent serious engine damage.  A lot of people think that this is a scam to drive in business.  I ask you to consider this: At my dealership, a basic oil change, (5 quarts or less with filter) runs $35.99.  OUR cost of the oil is around $2.00 a quart, and $5.00 for an AC Delco oil filter.  That's $15 just for the materials.  (Not including disposal, cleaning products, washer fluid, etc...)  Then the lube tech makes $12/hr (ish)  That comes around to $27 parts and labor cost to perform an oil change.  It doesn't take high level calculus to determine, dealers don't make shit off of oil changes.  It's not a scam.  It's in your best interest to change your oil.  
Recommended services.
I've only worked at two General Motors dealerships, so I can only speak to my experiences.  I do not get paid or receive any kind of perk for selling air filters, wiper blades, or anything of that sort.  In my dealership, we have a system of rating the severity of things we need to alert the customer about.  (Most of the concern is making sure the customer is aware of, serious issues, potentially severe issues, or something that may be an issue down the road.)  Any recommended services are prioritized on a 1-3 scale.  
1st priority in my mind is something a customer would want fixed before embarking on a lengthy road trip.  I don't want a customer breaking down in the middle of nowhere anymore than they do.
2nd priority is something that may not be a concern right now, but in the next 10,000 miles attention may need to be paid.  (We don't want the customer to say, ""Well it was just in here and you didn't say anything about it!!!"")
3rd priority is a mild seep, or something that could possibly become an issue at some point.  It doesn't usually need fixed at the moment, but at some point, it may be something you'd want to look at.
THE STEALERSHIP-
This makes me cringe.  Who do you want working on your car?  The guy who sees two every 6 months?  Or the guy who sees two a day?  The guy who knows every nook and cranny of your vehicle, and most times can tell you exactly what's wrong, just by hearing the concern?  In the area in which I live, our shop rate (at the GM dealer) is right in the middle of all the other shops in town.  ($79 flat rate)  I will admit, parts are going to be more expensive than a independent shop, because we are using factory parts and not aftermarket.  (Anyone who has had an aftermarket starter or alternator knows what I'm talking about.)  An aftermarket part may fix your concern for now, but chances are, you'll be performing the same repair again.  Conversely, if you replace the worn part with an OEM part, it will likely last the life of your vehicle.  (Again not always true, just one technician's opinion.)
Flat Rate:
The flat rate pay scale is what most dealerships and independent shops use for bidding jobs. We have a third party website, (Alldata, Mitchell, etc) that gives us an hourly amount to charge for a specific job.  For example: a water pump on a 2002 Chevy Pickup pays 1.8 hours.  If the technician screws up and ends up spending 14 hours on your truck, you are still only charged the 1.8 hours.  If the technician has done approximately 10,000 of said water pumps, it may take him .8 hours.  In that case, good for him, and good for you because he knows what he is doing from his previous experience.
Google, forums, and Fixya.
*sigh*  Would you go to your doctor and suggest you had lung cancer when you had a cough because you went on WebMD?  Same thing here.  You have a lot of angry people because their machine broke, and they think someone else should be responsible.  You will get 90% bullshit and maybe 10% good info IF you look hard enough.  Please, we want your vehicle fixed and in the best shape as much as you do.  Let us do what we do.
$900 for struts.  Scam?
*Cringe*  Dude, it's not our fault you bought a 98 Mercedes E class with Electro-hydraulic-pneumatic-flux capacitor struts.  They're $800 for parts and $100 for install.  DUH!
Recalls:
Ok, these are important I will admit, but the media and public hysteria has blown these way out of proportion.  Most vehicles involved in recalls would never have an issue.  (Most times 1% of affected vehicles will exhibit the dangerous condition.)  They are not a big deal, they are not an example of the quality of a vehicle, they are just things they didn't see coming during factory testing conditions.  Shit happens.  No one is perfect.  Shit breaks.  Such is life.  Be glad the auto manufacturers want to fix this for you for free.  (And P.S. the technicians make next to nothing for performing these recalls.  They are just as inconvenient to us.)
These are all just things I have noticed from browsing and answering this sub, forums, and others like it.  If you disagree with anything I have said, cool.  That's your right.  I am speaking as a man who does this for a living, and wants you to have the longest lasting, best performing, most reliable vehicle on the road.  I get off on fixing shit.  That's why I do what I do.  I am more than willing to answer any questions in which I am qualified.  One thought in closing, the guy who you talk to when you pick up your car after being repaired, usually is not the technician that worked on it.  So in the back of your mind, think of the guy that's got his knuckles scraped to shit, and has grease all over his face that made sure all your motor oil stayed in your engine, and know that guy is doing his best to ensure that you make it from A to B uneventfully.  We're not all con artists.
EDIT:  In hindsight, I did this stupidly.  I wrote this late last night, and went to bed.  Now it's 7:30 and I have to go to work.  Ugh.  I will get to all of the questions, please just bear with me.
EDIT 2:  As I said frequently throughout, this is just one technicians opinion.  Take it or leave it.  There will always be anecdotes to the contrary, but I'm speaking in broad terms.
EDIT 3:  Thanks for all the great questions and comments in this unofficial AMA.  Also thanks to u/reboticon for all the input and Co-hosting! "
"If I buy a brand new car off the lot while on a trip, is it ok to immediately take it on a 1000 mile trip to drive it home, as long as I follow the break in rules?
Pretty much what the title says.  I'm now shopping for a Nissan NV (5.6 V8) passenger van, and I've seen a lot of great deals in Florida.  I'm about 1000 miles away (NYC area) but the family is always down for a trip to see mickey mouse, and from what I am seeing online I could save $5k or more on the price of the car.  
Nissan says the break in period is 1200 miles and to avoid ""long periods at constant speed, either fast or slow, ... and over 4000 RPM"", full throttle acceleration, towing, quick starts, and hard braking.  
Is there anything wrong with doing the break-in ""all at once""?  Should I get an oil change halfway?   Thanks for the replies.  "
"Took my car to a dealership, now it won't run
About a month ago my wife drove our 2007 Hyundai Santa Fe into the local Hyundai dealersnip for a recall repair. The valve cover had been leaking oil onto our alternator, fouling out the alternator. The valve cover gasket replacement was covered under a recall, so they said they would replace it. We also asked them to check our car and see if there were any other issues with our vehicle so that we could consider repairs as needed. They called the next day and told us the car was done and ready to go. When my wife arrived to pick up the car, they told her everything was looking good and we were set to go. They sent a tech to collect our car for us. A few minutes later someone came and told her our car was not starting. She reminded them about the alternator that was causing problems, but stated that it was only intermittently going out and that it had been starting just fine with no real issues at present. They thought at that time that maybe they'd flooded the engine by trying to start the car too many times. They kept the car all day and said they would try to figure out the problem. Later that day, we were told that the spark plugs needed to be replaced, but when I arrived later on in the day to collect the car they were trying to get a new engine from Hyundai and telling us the engine was internally damaged. I asked what was damaged and they didn't know. I asked how they knew it was damaged and the mechanic that worked on the car said that he was getting no or very little compression on the front three cylinders (the three directly beneath the valve cover gasket that they had just replaced) and wasn't positive what was causing it, but suggested that the timing chain may have jumped. When I pointed out that the car had been just fine when we brought it to them (except for a oil-fouled alternator) the service manager talked down to me somewhat, telling me I only thought my car was running fine and really there had to be some underlying problem that caused it. He then said that the mechanic claimed that the car was slow to start that morning (but they never mentioned this to us until this point, even though we asked them to tell us of any other problems they noticed). At that point, we were no longer trusting that the dealership had our best interests at heart, so we chose to have our car towed from there.
A few days later, I called and talked to the service manager again. I asked what they could do to make this right and he told me that in order to make it right I would have to prove they had done something wrong. In my mind, the fact that the car was working properly up until they worked on it was proof enough, but not in his mind. All throughout this the service manager has insisted that the damage is purely coincidental and has absolutely nothing to do with anything they did, which as a mechanic myself, I know to be highly unlikely. I asked that the issue be escalated to his superior and that he contact me when they had a resolution. 
Upon having three other mechanics look at it, including myself, we found that a steel alignment pin on the bottom side of the valve cover was broken off and missing, along with part of the aluminum boss that it sits in. There is a fresh break in the aluminum boss with no corrosion or oil staining, implying that it happened very recently. This alignment pin normally sits into a corresponding alignment hole right next to the timing chain that drives the cams for the front three cylinders. We immediately suspected that some or all of this metal had fallen into the cavity behind the timing cover and had gotten into the chain, causing internal damage. 
I called the service manager again the next morning and told him what I found. He said that since they weren't the first ones to have the valve cover off (the valve cover gasket was replaced over a year ago for the same issue and before we became aware of the recall) that there was no way to prove that it was their fault without doing a teardown inspection. He said I would have to pay for said inspection unless they found proof that they had somehow caused it ""which is unlikely"" he said.  I offered to send him the pictures of the damage to the valve cover and I was told that ""that won't be necessary"". 
A borescope inspection of inside the engine revealed that there are metal fragments inside the engine, both in the bottom of the oil pan and on a ledge near the timing chain as well. In the opinion of the other mechanics we have been talking to, as well as my own opinion, we believe that the broken-off metal from the valve cover fell into the timing chain and caused the engine to jump timing. 
The dealership is refusing to assist us in any way- they will not cover the cost of a replacement engine, they are denying any and all responsibility for our car not working, they are not returning our phone calls in a timely manner (or at all), and they do not seem to be working toward any kind of resolution. We brought them a working vehicle and now our family is out one car, what can we do? "
"Advice to all of you
Stop taking your cars to chain stores! 
I have been subscribed to this reddit for over a year now and that is the best piece of advice all of you need to hear. National tire, canadian tire, jiffy lube, Halfords, Goodyear, quick fit, etc are not where you go for diagnosis. If you need an oil change, fine, if they have the best price on tires, ok, but for ANYTHING more involved, find a real mechanic.
The dealership is also not your friend. Once the warranty has expired, forget about them unless you have deep pockets. Most of them do decent enough work, but they are VERY profit driven and take a ""replace parts until the problem goes away"" attitude in most cases. they can fix anything, eventually, but it will cost you. 
So, now, today, while your car is running fine, find a mechanic. Google it to find a good one. in your town there will be a german, japanese, or american car specialists. It will be staffed by guys who used to work at dealerships, and left to go be REAL mechanics. They will actually diagnose problems rather than just throw parts at cars. They know what the common problems are. They know how to actually fix things and not just replace everything. And most importantly, they really give a shit about your satisfaction. They need you to tell your friends they did a good job. They survive on reputation. The dealership and all the chains don't give a shit about any of this, they have multimillion dollar advertising campaigns bringing in the soccer moms, they don't give a damn if you are happy, just that you pay and leave, so they can hit the monthly sales bonus. 
So now, today, find the local shop that works on YOUR car. Google it. Search forums. email the local enthusiast club if your car has one for recommendations, and write than phone number down in your wallet, or glovebox, or put it in your phone. So the next time your car overheats, or a warning light comes on, or it won't start, you can call someone who give a shit about you, and your car.
All too many posts on this reddit are the result of people taking cars into chain stores for jobs those clowns have no business dealing with. The chains are staffed by kids who either just started and don't know what they are doing yet, or have been at it for a few years and are so terrible at it they cannot get a real job at a real shop. They have their place (tires) but should not be doing your head gasket, or clutch, or frankly any job that takes more than an hour.
AND HERE COMES THE 24 HRS LATER EDIT- It seems a fair few of you are misunderstanding what I am driving at here. Yes of course there are occasionally good mechanics at chain stores, and yes, most of the guys at dealerships (well most is exaggerating, lets say ""some"") are doing their best, being as honest as they can, and know what they are doing. And absolutely there are TONS of independent shops that are staffed and run by borderline criminals, but you are all confusing ""independent"" with ""specialist"". 
What I am getting at is this. Midas, jiffy lube, and the like cause the majority of the questions on this sub (they also seem to be pretty popular on r/justrolledintotheshop) and they should be avoided at all costs. They damn sure are not who you go to if your car breaks down. Maybe tires and or oil if you find a good one. 
the dealership can fix everything (Like I said) but it will be very expensive. Simple as that. The mechanics are usually honest guys, and you will just about never be able to actually talk to him. You get to talk to the service writer, and all he wants to do is upsell brake pads and ball joints. Yes it will get fixed, yes it will get done right, yes it will be done quickly, and yes it will be expensive.
What you want to find is the specialist shop, that charges 1/2-3/4 of what the dealer does, is staffed by ex-dealer techs (who got sick of all the endless paperwork) and is well reviewed. If you drive a '72 Alfa and live in Des Moines, then you are fucked. I get it. But most people can find a place in most towns, that are was I am describing. They won't be the cheapest in town, but they will be much less than the dealership.
And yes, I am painting with a broad brush here, and it is all anecdotal. I have been a dealership mechanic for Porsche, VW, and Audi, on both U.S. coasts, and in England. And I have worked for 2 Porsche independent specialists in the states, and an American car specialists here in the U.K. I've been at this for over 20 years. You take it for what its worth, free advice from some guy on the internet. There are exceptions for every rule (I obviously used to be one of them), but on the whole, this is the state of things as I see it"
"TIFU by changing my wheel bearings
This happened yesterday.
I drive a DC2 Integra LS. Over the past month, my driver side wheel bearing has been howling louder and louder, and I've been wondering when the hell I was gonna fix it. I figured, I have to do the bearings in pairs at least, and to pay a shop to disassemble both sides of the front end just to swap two relatively cheap bearings, was probably not worth the money.
Black Friday I set out to purchase everything I needed. A floor press, a bearing press kit (the discs that match the diameters needed for tha pressin') and a myriad of other tools, like a ball joint separator and some sockets.
Fast forward to Saturday. I drive the car up to my designated borrowed driveway and get to work. Impact gun and penetrating fluid made quick work up until the lower ball joint. Couldn't get the gun under it, so I used a breaker bar--ball joint promptly breaks and the nut and bolt spin together freely. 
Run to the store. Buy both lower ball joints and both upper ball joints. Up until now the only parts I intended to replace out of financial security were the bearings, retaining rings, cv axles and axle nuts. So there goes another $200.
Knuckles off, go over to assemble the press. Harbor Freight didn't give me one of the boxes, so I had to drive back down to get the rest of the parts for the press. Come back to get to work.
After trying a few different ways, the hub popped cleanly out of the bearing which remained in the knuckle--only it brought something with it: the inner race is still on the hub. Damn. Pressed the bearing out of the knuckle and check YouTube.
For me I saw four possible approaches. The torch method--don't have a torch. Could throw the whole spindle in the oven and then use a wet rag to cool the knuckle enough to give room for the race to slide off. Eh. Now I could use a dremel tool or a disc grinder.
I opted for the disc grinder. After trying to put some notches in the race, I tried and failed to make it crack with my BFH and (wood) chisel. :/ gotta keep grinding I guess, race must be too thick to break still.
After a few frustrated minutes, I hold up the spindle to the light to look at my handiwork. I can clearly see that my groove is deeper than the race, and is now in the spindle by at least a sixteenth of an inch.
New spindles coming tomorrow. :/ any advice for next time guys? Thanks.
TL;DR: cut some nice grooves in my spindle trying to get a stuck on wheel bearing inner race, cus I didn't want to replace my hubs at first. Ended up having to order them online while my car sits on jack stands."
"I just changed the brakes (first time)
I just changed my brakes for the first time and let me tell you they needed it. The pads were bare metal. I changed the rotors as well because they were rusty. So here's the problem, after I put everything back together all was well until I started the break in process. I did 5 moderate stops from 45mph down to 10mph and 5 from 35 down to 5 then drove around for 5 minutes without stopping or using the brakes. But my front left wheel still sounds like it's scraping or something. Anyone know what this could be? I have ceramic pads if that matters. Thanks in advance
Edit: I stopped in at O'Reilly's and was told that it was the calipers that are sticking and making the noise.
Edit 2: SOLVED! As ApocalypticCat had suggested it was the heat shield touching the rotor."
"I let Best Buy work on my Car. This was a mistake. Where should I go from here?
On Saturday, I dropped my 2002 Dodge Grand Caravan off for a Remote Install. The check engine light was on (Evap issue) but no real other problems. They wrote down that the check engine light was on but didn't write down any codes.
Saturday afternoon, they give me a call. Everythings done, come pick it up! We head over to the Best Buy about 12 miles away, and they start showing off all of the new features we've got. The car starts up great with no key. So I asked them ""So can I operate the vehicle without a key now?""
They tell me no, if you hit the brake without the key in, it will shut off. For example *and the guy taps the breaks* 
The car doesn't turn off. No big deal they say. They say it will take 15 minutes to fix and we'll be on our way. My wife was gonna be late for work, but nothing major. We waited.
15 minutes later, it's good to go. Remote start works. Brakes shut it off. We seem fine. I hop in, shift gears, and it's telling me I'm in every gear at once. They say it's fine, bring it back in tomorrow at 11 and we'll double check things.
The drive home did not go well. The speedometer stopped working. The odometer didn't move. The gas fluctuated.
The worst problem, the van was revving up pretty high. It started off normal, but it slowly climbed to about 1k to 2k higher than it typically goes to. I was doing 60 on the highway headed home and it was between 4k and 4.5k RPMs where it usually doesn't go much higher than 3k.
Seems ok besides that. The engine nearly cut off a bit when we were off highway, but seemed to kick itself back on and hasn't done it since.
I called them and ask for a tow back. They said it's not something they can provide at this time.
I bring it back the next day at 11. Drives about the same, the speedometer and odometer worked for the first few miles then cut off again. They said it should be fixed in a few hours. About 5 hours pass and they call me. Say my Transmission Control Module is bad, which is why it's not working properly. They uninstalled the unit and refunded all of my money, but now my van is not functioning.
At this point, what can I do? What should I do? I understand this is not /r/legaladvice but maybe someone here has run into the same situation?
TL;DR I let Best Buy attempt to install a remote starter. It didn't go well. They refunded money but vehicle is not properly running now. What do I do?
Edit 1: In Case anyone reviews this. I brought it to a dealer.... and they told me theres a bad Transmission Control Module. I pretty much already knew that... so that was a great $135 spent. They also said it was unlikely that the Remote Start caused the issue.
I'm getting a second opinion because I don't believe it was a coincidence, but we will see.
Edit 2: I got a second opinion. They found in my favor and said it was completely Best Buys fault and pointed out many errors in the wiring. I'm getting a quote for the repairs and will bring it over to Best Buy for the refund. I was told I should give Best Buy the justification and the amount repairs will be, they will send it to their insurance for their final approval."
"Shop botched oil change, two months of engine troubles
2007 Hyundai Sonata 2.4  
147,000ish miles
This is going to be lengthy, I apologize, but I don't know which details are important.
I had an oil change done at a chain auto shop (think smaller Jiffy Lube) in late September. The drain plug was not replaced properly and fell out a couple hours later while I was grocery shopping. [The oil drained away from the driver's side door](http://i.imgur.com/pJ0wSBv.jpg), so I did not realize there was an issue until I started it. I would never have started the car had I noticed it. The dashboard immediately lit up like Christmas and I heard all sorts of horrible noises coming from the engine. I turned it off and had it towed home.
The next day, a representative from the shop came out, put in a new plug, replaced the oil, apologized profusely and left. I started the vehicle, which took much longer than normal, and began to drive. There was nothing right about how it ran. Symptoms include: very long startup, poor acceleration, stalling, engine bogging out if the pedal is pressed too far, lurchy gear shifts, bouncy RPMs, trouble on even slight inclines, and rough idling, to name a few.
I immediately took it back to the shop and they ran some tests, came up with a P0340 (camshaft position sensor circuit malfunction) code and said it's in limp mode. They replaced the camshaft position sensor a couple days later, apparently started it up fine, told me it was good, and sent me on my way. They were wrong. I didn't even have to get it off the lot to realize it drove no differently, and it still took a long time to start up. Brought it right back.
Over the next month, they replaced the camshaft sensor twice, the crankshaft sensor, the throttle body, and an oil control valve ([CVVT is showing limp home mode on the diagnostics tool](http://i.imgur.com/fHP5BDM.jpg)). The throttle body has been reprogrammed and the ECU has been reflashed at a Hyundai dealership and nothing has been successful. Thankfully, they did not charge me for anything that didn't work on their end. I don't mean to sound unappreciative of that, but the guess and check game has amounted to little more than a giant waste of time and money. They've been allowing me to drive the car, claiming it will not do any further damage, so I am trusting their word on that.
I have been thoroughly convinced that this is not a sensor issue from the start and told them so, despite their insistence. I'm not a car guy by any means, but I've done a ton of research on this so as not to get screwed when they inevitably tried to tell me it's my fault. After probably ten trips to them (on the advice of a mechanic friend, I would not let another shop touch it) for attempted repairs over the course of the month, they have given up, saying the higher-ups won't allow them to do any more because it has cost too much in labor and parts. The guy who did the original oil change has been fired over this. They obviously know they're responsible, but are now stonewalling me. When I suggested the timing chain may have been stretched or jumped when the engine was turned on without oil, I was met with hostility by the shop manager claiming ""no, that's not possible, the engine runs fine.""
After some negotiation, they paid for it to go to a Hyundai dealership for a new sensor. Hyundai re-replaced the cam sensor, claiming it needed to be Hyundai-specific, which the first replacements from the shop were not. This, of course, had no effect.
 
The guy at the Hyundai counter gave me the bad news, tells me they found a possible air intake leak, and says that's next on the list of things to try. This doesn't make sense to me, considering the context of the initial problem. As I'm looking over the paperwork and running costs in my head, I overheard a mechanic telling the counter guy that it is actually very likely related to the oil falling out, rather than an air leak. I called him over to give me his opinion.
He tells me exactly what I've been looking to hear for two months: the lack of oil probably screwed up a tensioner or the timing chain when I turned it on--some sort of mechanical failure, but it would require digging into the engine to find, which is expensive. I really couldn't help but smile because he is the first person in two months who has even mentioned the timing to me, and didn't look at me like I was crazy when I brought it up.
He gave me a rundown of the steps they take to diagnose these problems. Working down the list, they must follow protocol and rule out simpler causes before getting to the point of looking at the timing chain. He told me it will be cheaper to replace the engine than to get down that far on the list. Big thank you to that guy for telling me what's up without any spin.
My car is my livelihood. I am nearly out of money because of this. I have missed a substantial amount of pay because of the bullheaded insistence that the engine was not damaged in this ordeal (thank god my employer understands the situation and has allowed me to take on a different role to keep a base income). I understand that sometimes things break. I don't get upset if something small happens while my vehicle is being repaired. However, the car was running perfectly when it left the shop, the oil came out, and now I'd have better luck getting around with a $200 scrap car. The engine seems to have gotten progressively worse. If I am right and this is in fact the cause, I'm afraid it will hit a no-start condition soon, stranding me somewhere, or stalling out on an icy road.
I'm currently waiting to hear back from the original shop on what their plans are with this new information. It's been two months since this started. I'm on my last bit of patience trying to negotiate and coordinate with people who have no grease on their hands and won't listen to the owner of the vehicle.
My questions:
A. Am I on the right track? How common would a timing chain malfunction be in this scenario? Was that the sound I heard the night the oil came out?
B. Considering I now have a Hyundai professional all but physically confirming my suspicions, do I have grounds for a lawsuit if the shop still refuses to get my car back in working order?
Thank you."
"General Terminology Advice regarding no-start issues
All of the different terms people use to describe how their car won't start can be confusing, so here's a break down of the various terms, and how you should use them.
No Crank, No Start - I turn the key, and the starter does not rotate the engine. The engine is not cranking. (Dead battery, bad starter, bad ignition switch, seized engine, etc)
Crank, No Start - I turn the key, the starter DOES rotate the engine, but the cylinders do not fire at all and the engine only turns as long as I engage the starter. (No fuel, no spark, etc)
Turn Over - I turn the key, the starter rotates the engine, and the cylinders fire (but may or may not START the engine). The combustion in the cylinders is turning the engine over but the engine may not necessarily begin to run on its own. (Timing, weak spark, low fuel pressure, low compression) 
Start - I turn the key, the starter rotates the engine, the engine turns over, and begins running in its own."
"Should I Replace my timing belt (am i an idiot)
I have an 06 Subaru Impreza Outback Sport with 141,000 miles. It's run well to this point (fixes here and there), but has never had it's timing belt replaced. I've heard this is a problem with Subarus. I was planning on driving from Massachusetts to Colorado in the next few weeks (almost 2,000 miles). Is this a horrible decision, am I just asking to break down on the side of the road?

"Auto shop owners and self employed mechanics - can I ask you a few question about the business side?
Hey guys,
A friend of mine is self employed mechanic, he's a master diagnostic tech and has worked at many main dealers and big firms for over 25 years. Let's call him ""W."" He's been trading by himself for two years now. There's nothing he can't fix and his knowledge and skill as a mechanic is tremendous, but he struggles with some business aspects that I don't think he anticipated. I'm also self employed and I offer advice where I can, but I wondered how some of you would deal with specific scenarios like this.
**1. Diagnostics take hours and hours on a piece of shit car and cost of diag comes close to or exceeds car's value.**
W usually won't charge the number of labor hours he's spent diagnosing the problem. He barely breaks even on jobs like this.
**2. Major repair work on a piece of shit that exceeds car's value.**
We had a Renault with a snapped timing belt, the head had to be taken off three times before it ran right. W can fix anything, but I get the feeling he doesn't know when to quit. Again, he won't charge full for the work he's done.
**3. Customer doesn't pay.**
W is very lax with payment and he gives his customers waaaaaay too much leeway on when they're going to pay. He has a lot of deadbeats who owe him and doesn't pursue the money because he doesn't like confrontation. He contracted for one company and let them rack up an eye watering 5 digit debt - because he kept listening to the owner's BS excuses and thought ""he's nice."" No one is nice enough not to pay *me* and I'd have broken this guy's legs by now, and that's after he's ignored multiple court orders to pay his creditors including W. 
**4. Estimated cost of job fall far short of actual cost.**
Say he gives an estimate and then realises that the part will cost three times more than he anticipated. He will usually just wipe off his margin on the parts and possibly his labor too to get the final cost close to his estimate, I've tried to explain that an estimate is not a quote. fears customer will go somewhere else.
**5. Job goes on way longer and gets more expensive as it goes.**
What do you tell the customer? What choices do you have in getting rid of a bad job you know won't pay?
There are a few more, but basically he seems to absolutely hates charging people money because he doesn't like to upset people. People keep bringing him absolute heaps that really should have gone to scrap and he knows he can fix it but he can't do it for a profit. He worries people will say he's no good if he turns work down, but he won't charge an amount he'll make money from if he does take the job. It's so rare for him to just get a simple fucking service with no problems in and make some cash, and he's always broke even though he works 7 days a week. I feel like he's being way too nice to his customers and he needs to realise he's not a charity. I just feel like he could be making a decent living if he had more business discipline.
I don't think I can do anything as he's over 40 and this is just who he is, but I'd be interested to hear what you guys would do in his shoes.
Sorry for the wall of text :)."
"Mechanic is acting weird and I'm not great with cars....help? 2002 Nissan Frontier had the engine replaced
Hi there. I'll try to make a long story short so I'll just break it down in bullet points because this shit is driving me crazy. My truck ran great for 16 years and then had an issue with the engine and since I've taken it in the problems continue to pile up...
February 2018: Radiator cracks and I have it replaced by mechanic #1. It runs fine for about a month...
March 2018: Steam starts pouring from under the hood again but from the coolant section. Take it to mechanic #1 and he said the head gasket cracked and it was too big of a job for him to do (smaller mechanic known for oil changes/smogging). So I take it to mechanic #2 that we will call Jay. Jay makes a good offer on replacing the engine and claims he ""treats his customers like family and treats them how he would wanna be treated and loves his mechanics"" blah blah salesmanship. Oh well it's the first time I've been there. He takes a while to replace it but once it comes back it runs fine for about 4 months...
July 2018: Truck won't start one morning. i replace battery myself only to find that isn't the problem. I take it back to Jay and he replaces the starter for $200 after not remembering who I was from the engine replacement and then proceeds to tell me again about how ""he is a great guy and treats his customers amazingly and how he would wanna be treated and I can trust him"" all without me even asking or indicating I didn't have confidence in him.
January 2019: There is a weird noise coming from exhaust manifold, I take it back to Jay and he claims the catalytic converters are bad and are causing the exhaust manifold to overheat and thus, made it crack. He showed me the exhaust and sure enough there was a crack right down the middle. He replaced it and said it was due to parts he did not need to replace during the engine replacement, so it wasn't his fault. He charges me $1200 but he claims he is still taking off quite a bit of money since ""I'm his customer, I should trust him, he's a great guy"" but for whatever reason, he didn't recognize me from the previous 2 fixes.
April 2019: Car jolts a few times at start up. There was no error light so I thought I should be careful, I take it back to Jay and he claims he hooks it up to an error meter and that it didn't bring up any errors or anything and that the truck is fine. He charges me $70 for a diagnosis but ""normally it's $90 but since you're a great customer and I treat my customers like family, I'll take some off the top"". At this point I'm annoyed from having to take it back so much and from his oily salesmanship. He has my business, why does he keep trying to sell me and why does he not remember me from coming in so much if his customers are so important?
May 2019: The jolting at start-up doesn't go away and actually gets worse. My mpg's are starting to drop and finally the check engine light turns on. I take it to autozone and hook it up to their error meter and it says that a spark plug is causing cylinder 4 to misfire. I call Jay and he says ""welllll an error did come up when you brought it in last month but it wasn't counting anything so it wasn't a big deal. you should sue autozone because they shouldn't be able to tell you that"". Well the fucking truck is jolting on start up and it definitely seems like cylinder 4 is misfiring. On top of that why did he never tell me there was an error when I brought it in in March?
Is this guy jerking me around or is it just an old truck that's starting to catch up on its years?"
"Things to look out for when buying an old car?
Long story short... a friend of mine's grandma can no longer drive and she is looking to sell her 1999 HONDA CRV. The car has 95,000 km on it and has never been in an accident, nor has it required any irregular maintenance. It was brought in for regular oil changes and what not, and the body is in good condition. All parts inside and out are stock.
I'm wondering 2 things. 1, what kind of price should I be paying for such a car. And 2, what do I need to look out for? I'm thinking, even though it has low mileage, a car like that will start to break down simply from age. Is there truth to that? What should I expect to replace in the near future? "

"Well-informed vs. semi-informed vs. clueless: from a mechanic's perspective, which is a better customer? <NA>
This is a discussion question, not a question about a specific problem with a car.
I'm sure this scenario is nothing new to this subreddit: a friend of mine had his car break down recently. He's not very knowledgeable about cars in general -- knows where to put in the gas, how to check the oil, and that's about it. Over the course of about 10 days he towed his car to three different shops because he didn't want to pay what they were asking (he's a college student with more time than money, apparently). The final shop he went to had the lowest price (by a little less than $200), but botched the repair. I believe they fixed it eventually, but it meant he was out of his car for several more days. He was pretty frustrated by the whole ordeal, lamenting his distrust of mechanics, etc.
My assumption is that a lot of customers feel this way because they are more or less clueless about their cars. They don't know the difference between a catalytic converter and flux capacitor. I would think that the not-knowing leads to insecurity which leads to mistrust. 
**So, the question is:** What would you rather have and why? A customer who: 
* is completely cluess about what is going on with the car
* is very knowledgable about what is going on with the car (and isn't afraid to tell you what he/she thinks)
* is somewhat educated on what might be wrong with his/her car
Does just a little bit of education make a better customer?
*By the way, I believe my friend had his alternator replaced, which isn't really the point of this post, but you might be wondering.*"

"How to Diagnose a No Start Condition and ... Realizations After Helping A Neighbor... There Are Some People You Shouldn't Help
I think this can be applied to most any situation but yesterday my neighbor asked for some help with their vehicle that was not starting and I thought I would share the experience.
I work from home and I am on the phone with someone and my neighbor comes knocking.. the day before a flatbed dropped off his car in front of his house... actually not his house he is living with his aunt.. but the guy is a man in his 50's.. he shows up with his jacket on .. in his pajamas with slippers at about 2pm and asks if he can borrow my code scanner... so I don't lend tools so I say give me 20 mins and I will be over.. I am in a very important phone call that means probably $50k or about that .. he comes knocking again.. its been about 15 minutes .. he is dressed at least this time... I say wait and I will be out.. I finish the call and go over.
Now its been all night and the previous day... its now about 2:30 and he has done nothing all day.. and he is unemployed right now so there is no excuse.
I hook up the odb2 to see if there are any stored codes. I try to crank it and the battery is dead.
Im like theres no way i am charging this guys battery for 6hrs .. I have told him many times before get a $25 charger.. so I go get my jumpstart but its not fully charged i only get 2 cranks out of it.. so the starter works right..
I tell him look in the Oil Fill and see if the overhead cam spins at all .. it did move.. so its not the timing belt
A lot of dicking around and finally he says take me to walmart and he will buy a battery. I say ok it might not be the battery but ok lets go. what you really need is to buy a fricken charger that I have been telling you to get for the last 3 years.
&#x200B;
I drive him down.. I look up the battery for the guy before we leave.. I get the size and prices.. find a coupon for AdvanceAuto just incase the walmart doesn't have this battery in stock because their inventory sucks at this store they don't even stock starter fluid.
&#x200B;
We get home and put the battery in the old one is a sealed battery but its got powder all over it.. its old .. the labels are worn off it.. can't even find a date .. so he is better off with a new one anyway.
We try to start it and it cranks
I grab the almost empty can of starting fluid and remove a breather tube right at the throttle body and give it a good squirt... the car trys to start and runs a few seconds pretty well..
so its not the coil or wires and its getting spark
&#x200B;
So its not getting fuel for some reason but its kinda trying to start... ok one step closer
I start checking fuses and finally find the fuel pump relay... Thought I got lucky and could swap the AT Controller Relay with it to see if we could get a start but its a different part number.. actually he caught that .. so the guy is not totally fricken clueless.
&#x200B;
By this time his uncle shows up.. another uncle not the home owner's husband.. he is also living with this poor woman and has a dui so he can't get his license but he owns a car in the driveway that the guy I am helping says the insurance is in his name but he won't let him use the car...
This guy starts pulling plug wires saying its electrical.. even though while he is there I shoot starter fluid in the vent tube and get it to run for a few seconds... he is walking around with candy in his mouth sucking his teeth complaining..
I am the only one working on this car .. I am not helping.. I am doing
I tell him .. (and its now after 4 and the sun is going down) that he needs to pull the back seat out and test if there is power to the fuel pump when he hits the key... If there is power then its the fuel pump .. if there is no power then maybe its the relay or something else...
&#x200B;
So I am walking away as the both of them try to get the backseat out of the car.. sun is going down.. and I am thinking to myself .. wow what a headache.
&#x200B;
**So this morning I came to this realization...**
**There are 2 types of people that ask for your help**
There are people that do the research.. make plans on how to do something.. they get in a situation and they can't actually get the thing done without another person's help and they really just need your help to get past that one thing and they will do the rest. Maybe they need advise... Maybe they need you to hold a flashlight... whatever.. BUT they are doing this thing and you are just helping.
&#x200B;
Then there are guys like my neighbor.. car breaks down.. gets it towed home.. sits on it all day and night.. doesn't even google for what it might be.. didn't buy a $50 OEM Service Manual or even a chiltons.. Can't be bothered to pay $15 on Amazon for a ODB2 scanner because he can buy beer with that money.. Doesn't arrange with his family member to use a car that runs.. is inspected and has insurance on it that he is paying for so he can do parts runs... And then shows up at your front door in his Pajamas like he is 7 years old expecting you to do all the work for him....
This guy isn't asking for help.. he is asking you to do it for him because he can't be bothered... can't even be bothered to put on a pair of pants or google for some help.. 50+ years old and not acting like an adult which he has been for 30 years. The guy is collecting welfare but obviously has been doing so long enough that he had a working car and could have found some type of job in the past weeks...
That is the problem.. He could probably do the work.. the guy is healthy.. spends time at the gym.. he is not an idiot and could do the same things that you did ... which was educating yourself about some of the bigger items that you own like fixing your car or home or whatever... But its just not worth it to him
&#x200B;
**So ... if your car won't start..**
Make sure your battery is charged enough to crank the engine.
Squirt some starting fluid in the intake and see if it fires up.
If it does you have a fuel supply problem
Turn your key to the on position and listen for your fuel pump to hum for about 10 seconds. Opening your gas cap might let you listen better if you are in doubt and have a helper to turn the key.
If you hear nothing then your fuel pump is probably bad but it could be a relay or fuse or maybe even a sensor depending on your model of cars. Fords have reset buttons that will turn off your fuel if you get bumped or hard stop.. to stop fuel running in an accident situation.. most other cars do not.
If you have power to the fuel pump then the pump is bad
&#x200B;
If you have fuel and starting fluid won't start your engine when its cranking then start looking for an ignition problem.
&#x200B;
Sensors, relays, fuses... and things like fuel pumps, coils and other things need to be systematically checked.
buy the fricken Manufacturer's Service Manual for your exact model and year of car.. They are put together by Engineers for Dealership Mechanics  to fix your exact car... you are paying thousands for a car but cant pay for the service manual.. that means either you hunt and guess in the dark or you pay a mechanic fix your car.
buy some basic tools like a Volt Meter, Test Light, Socket set, Hand wrenches, screw drivers, pliers ... and a $15 ODB2 Scanner off amazon or ebay.. Maybe $200 at harbor freight or online and its going to save you thousands over time.
AND PUT SOME DAM PANTS ON WHEN YOU GO TO YOUR NEIGHBOR ASKING FOR HELP... :o)
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
EDIT Update... neighbor has another guy out there in the backseat pounding on stuff .. i walk over ... looks like he is getting him to change the fuel pump.. GOOD NOT ME.. heh
&#x200B;
Man don't learn how to do anything yourself just find other people to do it.. he is now in his house waiting for it to be done for him.. the uncle is out there with the other guy.. 50yo pajama boy .. its so fricken real heh"

Sad Face :c :[ :'c :'[   The crack looks more superficial and not too deep but I don't know anything about cars. I was planning to replace the entire windshield, but looking at yelp, there's this quick and $20 service to repair the cracks.

"Problems with the engine (?) of a '99 VW Golf Mk IV
Hey everyone! :D
So, let's get straight to the point. There is a Mk IV Golf, built in 1999, 1.6 petrol and it is a rather lovely ""Generation"" Special Edition in a really cool color with lots of nice details.
It recently passed 130k Kilometers and while it is still a car I absolutely adore (even though it doesn't belong to me, but someone near to me) it recently didn't pass the TÜV as we call it in Germany (I think the UK-equivalent would be MOT, but I have no idea how you call it in the US...It is some sort of legally-mandated test cars have to pass).
The things that are really broken can be repaired, but there is the question whether the money should be invested or spent on something new.
And there is one thing which has been bothering me constantly. The actual owner of the car says that it ain't a problem unless the car breaks down, but I want to make sure it isn't a bad sign which will lead to more problems in the future. I think it is the same overall problem, which appears in 3 different situations.
1. When starting the car, the engine revs uncontrollably. Not very high, from ~ 500-1500rpm. It just goes up and down a few times before settling at a normal point.
Also, when the headlights are on during that period, they start flickering.
2. It is horrible to get off the clutch and start driving. I've driven quite a number of different cars and for getting started in this Golf you basically need magic powers. Last time I drove it, I killed it 5 times before I finally could drive normally. In any other car, it doesn't happen to me at all nowadays (Even though it also happended quite a few times during driving lessons, lol xD)
3. When I'm driving and press the gas pedal just a single, short time (Just one tap with my foot) it reacts...strange. After noticing it for the first time, I tried that in other cars and all others react like I think they should: They just push forward a bit. But the Golf just makes a really strange, strong hop, that happens with a barely noticeable delay. It is really weird. Tap the pedal --> Very, very, very short (But noticeable) delay --> Strong hop forwards.
So, those are the 3 problems. I think they might have the same reason, but I don't know much about Mechanics...
I hope someone here can help me :D
Kindest Regards"
"Car accident. Insurance wants to total. My mechanic thinks he can fix it. 3rd opinions?
An F-150 hit my van (2005 Dodge Caravan) from behind.  (http://imgur.com/6ENq1vY) (Yes, that is the Ford's license plate imprinted in the hatch)  It drives fine.  The break lights work, it appears to be legal.  I put 50 miles on it going to work and back this week, can't tell any difference (except air drag from the missing back window).
The Ford's insurance company hired an appraiser.  The appraiser said the frame is buckled, and it would cost $7000 to fix.  The Insurance company offered us around $5200, which is what kelley blue book says is the expected dealer price.  They say they'll sell the car back to me as scrap for $1125.
My mechanic has always treated me fair, and (as far as I know) been straight with me.  I brought it down, and he said he could replace the hatch, and bumper, straighten out the side panel, and make the thing work for under $2000.  It won't be as good as new, there will be some paint mismatch, and bumps in the panels he doesn't replace.  Still, he says it will be serviceable.
I can't see any evidence the frame is damaged.  The hatch is destroyed, the bumper will need to be replaced, along with whatever crush material is under it.  The left side panel is deformed.  Left tail light is out of place, but works fine.
I've gotten a number of opinions.  Mostly it boils down to my wife (and her father, and the Ford's insurance company) thinks we should just take the $5200, and buy another van.  Possibly taking the $5200 as a down payment on a newer one.  I (and my father, and my mechanic/cousin) think it can be fixed.  If I buy the scrap for $1125, and pay $2000 for repairs, I could probably drive it for a few more years.  I'd save the $2000 left over toward the maintenance/replacement fund.
If the frame is actually buckled, there is a legitimate concern about safety.  A damaged frame will be less resistant to another impact, and may cause problems to any number of other systems up the line.  Many of you will know more about this than I do.
I need to tread carefully.  She has her motherly concern for the safety of our 4 kids (hence why we have a van in the first place), and I must build a strong case for repairing the car if I'm to persuade her.  I've convinced my wife to at least let me take it to a body shop, and let them get in under the bumper to look for damage.  We've also agreed to talk to our favorite car dealer (an old family friend), and ask what he would do if it here his.
What does /r/MechanicAdvice think?  Is the risk of hidden damage such that I should just let them junk the car?  Should I let a body shop break down the back end before making a decision?  What else should I look at, or have looked at before I make the final decision?"
"How important is an OEM timing belt?
I typcally go to the dealer for oil changes, they are cheaper, friendlier and everything is just better... I also had some recalls on my 2005 Honda Pilot. 
The service rep suggested the scheduled maintenance for my 130K mile vehicle saying that the timing belt replacement could be important. 
Ok thats good, I can do that, but then he shows me the bill for $900 that includes the 105K mile check up, new timing belt, new serpentine belt etc..
I dont have $900 to sneeze into the wind so I asked him what is the disadvantage of going someplace with less overhead and he says that they may not use authentic parts.  This has never occurred to me since I typically get generic parts for things that wear down such as breaks, or wind sheild wipers but the timing bed could be a big deal.
How important is the OEM parts for something like the timing belt? I would hate to get a 20K mile rated timing belt when the honda timing belt is rated for 200K miles or get a belt that suffesr from lower quality.
How do I ask my local shop with less overhead? should I provide the part? what if he says no?

"Torque sticks: a rant
Why do auto shops insist on using torque sticks? I've always hand threaded my lug nuts, and torqued them with a torque wrench.

That made me a little bit upset, but I wasn't about to tell the dude how to do his job. I get home, removing my wheels to tape down the weights, and holy shit are the nuts cranked down. I felt like I was going to break my wheellock key. Even Costco has never gorilla'd the nuts on this tight. To add, the torque was wildly inconsistent. Some felt like 80 lbft, some needed my weight on the breaker bar to get them loose. Is a few seconds of time savings really worth potentially breaking things and pissing off your customers? "
"Manifold bolt broke off (big surprise). Need help figuring out how to remove it.
This is on a 2005 Silverado 1500 5.3L. I'll be putting long tubes on my truck next weekend and have been soaking the bolts for a few days now, and I just wanted to check a few bolts to see if they would budge... well it turns out a few of them have been broken for who knows how long. No big deal, I can drill most of them out. The only one I'm concerned about is the bolt in the far back on the driver's side. If 11/12 of the bolts broke, I was hoping this would be the one that stayed intact, but I'm not that lucky. I'm a pretty mechanically inclined DIYer, but I don't have access to a welder, so the option to weld a nut onto the stud is out of the picture. I do have a low profile right angle drill attachment that I'm gonna try and fit down there, but it'll be close because I only have about 4"" of room to work with between the head and firewall. Obviously the headers are still on right now, and taking them off will give me slightly more space with a drill. If I can catch a break, maybe there will be enough sticking out to grab hold of with a vice grip, but I was just wondering if anyone on here had any suggestions other than welding a nut on it, or pulling the heads.
I'm also on another forum where a bunch of people mentioned the same thing happening and they just left it and sprayed it with copper gasket spray. Any thoughts on that?

"Brake work on a 91 F250
The truck is a 91 F250 2wd with 3.55 limited slip rear. I've been having an issue that got worse the last few days, so I finally pulled the rear wheels and drums to take a look. The issue is, while driving, any touch of the brake pedal causes the rear wheels to lock up. I'm not sure if it's one side that's bad and the other is locking due to the limited slip. After a bit of driving, the locking up goes away, and then the pedal seems a bit harder, and I really have to press it hard to get the same amount of braking, then after that, maybe 10 minutes in of around town driving, it brakes as normal. Shut it down, so overnight and it does the same thing the next day. 
Possible causes I can think of:
It has been raining a lot lately, so maybe rust biluildup on the drums, though I didn't see any when I pulled them. 
Park brake sticking, the park break cables are new, but It seemed that the lever applying brakes connected to each cable was somewhat rusty and sticky. 
Auto adjusters, I don't know where the adjustment was at when I took the drums off, maybe just an adjustment and reinstall the wheels and it would be good to go? 
Pads, I'm not really sure how to gage them and tell when they need replacing. I will post some pictures shortly. 
The drivers side rear has new Springs, we had them worked on a while back to fix a leaking cylinder. The other side does not have new hardware IIRC. 
anything else that can cause this issue? What should I replace? Advice for doing any repair work? I have never worked on drum brakes before, but am willing to learn.
Edit: working on getting the images uploaded, imgur is giving me issues at the moment. There is one image showing one of the shoes and a small corner of it is missing, so I'm thinking pads need to be done at the very minimum. Spring kits too? Bleed the lines? New adjustment kits?

"Can I break the automatic transmission by driving wrong?
I'm from a country where automatic gears are quite rare (Poland), so it's hard to get information about it. Due to being.. er... bipedally challenged, I'm forced to use a car with automatic gear shift.
First thing is: are there any general things I should know about it? Stuf that are common knowledge in the U.S.A., but someone alien to the culture of auto shift could potentially break it if unaware?
The only thing I was told was to never change any gear to another without having fully pressed the brake pedal. So, what can I break if I do this? 
Drive <-> reverse or drive -> parking seem intuitive candidates for a FUBAR, but can something break if I shift to neutral while driving slowly up to traffic lights? 
This specific combination (drive -> neutral) is of most interest to me, because in manuals it allows you to let the car lose the rest of speed smoothly. Also, every automatic car I have driven, drive -> neutral change can actually be performed without pressing the button on stick handle, which otherwise has to be pressed to change gears. Why would this saftey be off for this particular change? Or is it just something that happens to old cars (the only kind I'd driven), and in new ones you actually have to stop and press the button before changing to neutral?
I also heard somewhere that it's detrimental to your engine/transmission to stay in neutral/parking on the red light or while waiting for someone etc., and that it's better to stay on drive with the brake pedal down. Is that true, and if it is, why? And maybe most importantly *how* bad it is, since if it's not *too* bad, I thiink I'm more concerned about the well being of my sole ankle than the car :) I mean, if I do it often, will the transmission break on average after a year, five, fifteen?
Anything else I should know?

"2006 6.0l f450 flatbed dies during interstate driving
My shop's 2006 6.0l f450 flatbed breaks down every delivery in the same place, about 40 Miles from home during interstate driving with a load way under capacity. (Uniform lockers: light weight, but not very aerodynamic on the freeway. Either way, shouldn't really matter.) 
It'll run fine for about 40 miles then break down like it's running out of fuel. No lights or codes, oil pressure, temp and battery are all stable. I'll let it sit for a few minutes, and after a few cranks it'll start, but only go a few hundred yards before shitting her pants again. If I can make it to the back roads, I can usually keep it going when taking it easy. 
I've replaced the Fuel filters, HPOP, 4 injectors, and the Fuel pump. When I replaced the fuel pump yesterday, I found a loose piece of electrical tape covering the pump's inlet, so I assumed I found the problem, but replaced the pump anyway. I went on my next delivery with no difference. 40 miles and I'm on the side of I20 again. 
Could it be the oil regulator? I haven't replaced it yet, so that's all I can think to do at this point.

"Mechanic has failed to fix issue three times.  What can I do?
Hi guys, 
I have a 2002 Honda Civic.  I think my mechanic is yanking me around.  I don't know what to do.  He has great reviews but in the past 3 months, my service has left me poorer and with a car that's worse off than it was before.
I live in Virginia.  My car started shaking on startup and jerking back and forth (not side to side) while pressing the gas about 2 months ago.  I brought it in to the shop, and they said I needed new spark plugs.  They did the repair, and it worked fine for 1 month and 2 days.  The problem started back, so I scheduled an appointment.  The day before my my appointment, my radiator cracked, so I got that replaced too.  They said an induction service would fix the spark plug issue.
A month and 3 days later, the jerking came back.  I immediately brought it in to the shop (Friday) and told them they needed to figure out the underlying issue because clearly something is causing the spark plugs to go.  They shouldn't break this often.  The diagnostic revealed that my ignition coils and fuel injectors needed replacement.  They said I could replace one of each and get along for a while until the others break down, or go ahead and replace them all and it would solve the problem.  I opted to replace them all.  I feel like they should have figured out what was going on from the start, or at least by the second time I was in the shop.
Less than 12 hours after the ""repair,"" my car starts jerking again.  But it's not jerking like before.  It's shaking violently when I idle, and it's jerking more than it ever has while driving (even when not pressing the gas).  It was terrifying to drive home in, and I had to use my hazards and drive under 40 (over 40 and the shaking got worse).  At one point, I pulled over to let the engine cool off a bit.  I popped the hood and smelled burning coolant.  So that means not only did they not get the coil problem fixed, but it seems like they didn't get the radiator fixed properly either.
This is a Midas, so a corporate chain, they have an A+ rating with the BBB at this location and glowing reviews all over the internet, and so I had no reason to believe they would jerk me around like this.  I don't know what to do.  I've poured every ounce of my savings into fixing this car, and they've essentially made it worse.  What can I do?  Do I have any legal recourse?  I'd like to ask them to pay for it to be repaired elsewhere because I don't trust them to do it anymore.  Or can I get a refund or something?  I'm so lost.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  
Thanks for reading.
**TL:DR** I think my mechanic is jerking me around.  Is there anything I can do?"
"2011 Porsche Cayenne with 16K repair estimate -- what's a dummy when it comes to cars to do?
2011 Porsche Cayenne with about 20K miles on it, maintained every year at our local dealership. 3.6 L V6 engine. No major issues before this incident. 
This is my mom's car. She's not the most car-savvy person and neither am I, so apologies in advance for any inaccurate use of nomenclature! A few weeks ago, the ""low coolant levels"" warning flashed. We replaced the coolant with the correct type. A few days after, the warning flashed again, at which point my mom was on her way to the dealership. Suddenly, the car made a loud ""ZZZZ"" sound and shut off. It had to be towed there. 
At the dealership, they were able to run the car for a few minutes, but then one of the cylinders misfired. They thought perhaps the gasket had to be replaced. After three weeks, dealership finally gave us a break down of the issues and price. [Here's the quoted price estimate -- looks like both the water pump and cylinder head need to be replaced.](https://imgur.com/a/uZ9cD) 
Now, this ain't a cheap repair at 16K. Our plan is to show the estimate to a few other dealerships and see if they concur with the price. However, I wanted to do some research on my own. My questions are: 1) is this estimate fair?; 2) if so, is it worth it to repair it at the dealership, or somewhere else?; 3) or, is the most fiscally salient option to trade the car in at this point?
Thank you all!"
"Can anyone recommend any books or resources for learning basic auto maintenance / repair? 
Hi! I've been traveling in my van (ford transit) for the last few years and I think it's time that I learn a bit more about how to maintain & fix it! I have pretty much no experience so the few times I've had problems, I've been at the mercy of the mechanic I break down nearest to.
I know the best way to learn would be to go to a class, but because I travel it's not often that I'm in one place long enough to do that. Are there are any good resources for gaining a basic understanding of what's going on under the hood? Or is it something that really needs to be taught face to face? 
Any help would be much appreciated!

"Habits to make Car last longer (Nissan Altima 2014)
I bought a used Nissan 2014 Altima last year. I currently drive 44 miles to work each way. I want to make my car last as long as possible, as I'm worried the pure mileage I put on it will mean it breaks down before I even pay it off. I try to not drive it too hard (I drive pretty passively usually). Besides frequent oil changes,what are some habits I can do that will make my car last as long as possible?"
"How do I jack up the rear of my car?!
Ok, I know this is basic questions but I don't get how to do it. 
I want to lift both of the rear wheels into the air (I need to do this to tighten the handbrake correctly according to the manual). So I've bought 2 stands and a hydraulic jack see [Imgur](http://imgur.com/a/lDcC5).
Now looking at the manual I need to lift each side on the sill? But surely the edge of the sill will bend because the top of the hydraulic stand is pretty much flat (i.e. the whole weight of the car will be on the sill edge rather than on the body of the sill). You can see in the manual 2nd photo that the jack that came with the car is not flat , but ""U"" shaped where the car rests on the top of the ""U"". But of course it says NOT to use that jack except in emergencies...
 Also, according to the picture there is one place on the rear of the car where i can put the stands, right in the centre? To me this looks like the car is going to be really unbalanced. I would have thought that it would be good to put the stands on the sides of the car somewhere? But of course if I'm lifting the car on the sill where the flange is, then I can't put stand there because the jack is using the flange?
So confused...
UPDATE: Leo_Kru's method worked. Successfully lifted up the back and tightened up the hand break. Only issue was when dropping the car back down, the hydraulic jack didn't drop to it's 0 position, but only until the wheels took the weight of the car. Which made it tricky to get it out from below the car. eventually managed to get it out by slapping it right/left.
Next up complete engine rebuild.... (I joke...I joke..)."
"Sub-$5000 truck that's reliable and easy to work on
I recently bought a new house and I'm considering buying a cheap beater truck for general hauling.
Ideally, I'd like to use this truck to begin learning basic car repair. I've done some AV stuff like installing backup cameras but never any real engine or transmission work.
I'd rather it not break down all the time but if it does I'd like to be able to make a decent attempt to fix it myself and not pay an arm and a leg for parts or super-specialized tools.

"Suddenly Only goes Backwards. 1985 E350 Ambulance. Please help.
That's right, it only goes backwards.  Its a 1985 E350 GAS ambulance without overdrive.  Its a 7.? liter engine.
Here is the most recent.... event.
I go to take it to work after all this super cold weather and I leave it running in the driveway, it was making a weird noise, and honestly I thought the noise was a bit of ice in my cooling system.  I know, I know, but that's what I imagined.
After maybe 4 minutes I'm lugging some tools to it and the smoke starts.  Its white smoke coming from where the transmission meets the engine, down low.
And it smells terrible, I mean like a chemical factory on fire.
It seems that my solenoid got sticky and kept sending juice to my starter.  I took of the starter and bench tested it, it was dead but the teeth were nice so that's good.
I put another one on, change the solenoid and she starts right up.  
I don't realize it but somewhere in here my electric in-tank fuel pump stops working.
I drive about 150 feet and she stalls - cause fuel pump.
But there is another thing - smoke from under the drivers dash.
Note - this is an ambulance that sat and people helped themselves to stuff - another hot wire will not surprise me a bit. 
I just wanted to get it off the road so I get myself all set to hand-feed the carb little bits of gas.
I get it running, and dang it, it will not go forward.  It will go backward.  
I can't figure it out, I dont think the tranny on the 85 has any electronics, but it does have a vacuum - could that do it? 
I am at a loss.  Please send ideas.
UPDATE
Its not the transmission.  I jacked the rear wheels and even with the driveshaft disconnected, the wheels only roll backwards.  I have a new question, is there something I can do to make this thing roll?
SOLVED: IT WAS THE RIGHT REAR DRUM.  I juggled some wires under the dash and my fuel pump woke up.  This gave me enough power to break it free using engine power.  THANK YOU EVERYBODY"
"How badly did I just fuck up?
Per [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicAdvice/comments/1d6rtj/weekend_project_2_advice_drain_tran_fill_atf4/), I just pulled off my ATF pan and replaced the filter + fluid.
Everything was going great -- it did turn out to be a lot harder than I expected -- except after a long day and the over-eagerness inherent to completing a difficult project, I pulled a rookie move.
After adding four quarts of ATF+4, I immediately checked the fluid level. It was perfect. Okay, great! Ignition, throw it in gear, and reverse up my driveway -- and then circled right back down into my driveway when I realized that something was not right. It wasn't shifting properly, at all, and made some uncomfortable sounds. I shut off the engine and popped the hood -- a fair amount of white-ish smoke drifted out. Crap.
So, I checked the fluid level -- bone dry.
Just how badly do you think I damaged my transmission? After adding more fluid, letting it run for a while, adding more fluid (in total, another four quarts) and shifting into D/N/R a few times with my foot on the break, it seems to be running great. I'm just concerned that it won't take long for my blunder to surface.
Despite what will probably turn out to be an expensive, stupid lesson, I'd just like to say thank you to everyone for all of the valuable input I've received in this subreddit. I'm really enjoying myself and look forward to many more weekends of working on my cars. But hopefully the dumb mistakes like I made today will be fewer and further between..

"Passenger window is slow to roll up or down.
I recently had my passenger window broken into. I had the glass vacuumed out of my car and window replaced. Now the window is slow to move up or down. The glass repair guy told me the motor is dying and it has nothing to do with the window being smashed in. I'm almost completely certain that it was fine before the break in. The car is 3 years old and all other windows work great. Does that sound like a long enough time for a motor to die? If the issue is a result of the break in then it will be covered by insurance, so I'm really hoping that's more likely the case. Thoughts?

Hey guys, I left for lunch break a little while ago (Letting the car idle for a bit, as it's pretty cold in NY right now) and while I was driving down the road, with the heat on, the smell of gasoline just started pouring into the cabin. Not exhaust from another car, just un-burned, fresh from the pump gasoline... I pulled into the parking lot for lunch with my gf, and sat in the car with it idling a bit more.

"I have a feeling a mechanic is trying to fully scam me and take advantage of both my lack of experience and financial situation. Story inside.
My ride is a 2002 Volvo Cross Country V70 XC Station Wagon. 
A few days ago my girlfriend went over a curb while making a right turn back on to the road, and there was a huge jostling bump. Later on that night while on the freeway, it started making some faint noises. Nothing alarming, but something was definitely off. A few minutes later they quickly shifted to sounds akin to scraping metal. I couldn't tell if it was under the hood or under the car itself, but I pulled over onto the shoulder as quickly as I could. I drove while the engine made those noises for less than ten - 15 seconds before pulling over. 
The tow guy arrives and he says he noticed I'm leaking oil and appear to be completely out, and the cause is a damaged oil pan from the prior bump. So I have it towed to a local shop and got in touch with the owner the following day. 
I told him what the tow guy told me, and he immediately quotes me the dealer price for a brand new oil pan for a hair under $500. He said I was looking at about at least $800 plus tax including labor. After telling him that wasn't happening and that I can buy a used pan on ebay for $75 with free shipping, I ask him if he'll do the repairs if I provide the part and just pay for labor. He's willing, but it will be ""a long job"". He tells me to leave it with him and he will get back to me. This was 03/30. The 31st comes and goes. No call. 04/01 comes and goes. No call. Finally this morning he calls and suddenly my engine is shot and it's $3000. When I tell him that isn't happening, he immediately expresses interest in buying my car for scrap value. No used engine option, no discussion of financing or payment plans, just let me buy your (now) junk. 
Naturally this happened shortly after losing my job, which I actually naively made mention of in hopes that if the guy was in fact crooked, he'd refrain from attempting to rip me off and cut me a break. Seeing as he was so quick to offer to buy it for scrap value, I can't help but feel kicked when I'm down. 
I smell bullshit. What I want to know is if the 10 or so seconds I drove it without oil is enough to destroy the engine. If so, maybe the guy is legit and I'm just pissed off at the cost. Otherwise I feel I pulled over pretty quickly. Is there a chance in hell I'm just being taken for a ride and a new oil pan and an oil change will set me straight? "
"Am I being hosed by my so-called friend?
Hello. I have a 2011 Hyundai Sonata GLS 2.6 L. I have a friend who has been repairing my car for a year. He doesn't have any formal training but his dad and brother are ""master mechanics."" He has done a lot of work on my car. At least some of the work were definite problems that he didn't cause and he did fix them. However, there are other problems that I am not sure if he caused or not. Or if he didn't cause them I don't know if he is lying about the solution.
The latest thing has to do with my brakes. They keep on making a high pitched squeak when I apply the brakes at speed. My friend couldn't figure out why the brakes keep squeaking. I suggested that since we replaced everything in the wheels (he had replaced the rotors, calipers, pads and probably a few other things in January) and it still squeaks then it must be something further in. He said that sounded possible and talked to his brother about it. His brother told him to have me do a few things and report back. So my friend told me to check the brake fluid level. It was almost all the way to the cap. He said to turn the car on and pump the breaks a few times, then look at the level. I did that and the level did not change and no bubbles formed either. He said that isnt good at all. He then told me to drive up and down the drive way a few times, pumping the breaks and then carefully feel the rotor. I did that and the rotor was dry as a bone. He said that isnt good either. There should be some very slight wetness. I didn't feel anything but metal and there wasnt even anything to wipe off of my fingers. He said that means that there is a clog in the line and the rotors are not getting any brake fluid to lube the rotors. He also said that since the rotors have not been getting lubrication, the whole system is ruined and needs replacing. He wants to replace the master cylinder, the slave cylinder, the brake line, the rotors, the caliper, the pads every damn thing. What do you think about all of this? Is there any chance that he is correct or am I being hosed? 
I apologize for how long this is. This whole situation has me worried. I hope that what I wrote is easily understood. It is 5 am here, I cant sleep so I decided to write this to get this off my chest. I am just not sure what to do. Any help would be very much appreciated.

"High Mileage 1992 Toyota Camry LE Stalling at idle, won't start up again for approx. 30 minutes.
Hello all, I'm hoping you can help me identify what is happening with my car.
2.2L engine, In-Line 4, 248000 miles, Squirrel has intermittently been living under the hood.
Last fall/winter I was having issues with my car where I would drive somewhere, the car would sit for 15-60 minutes, and when I came back the car would not start. I didn't have enough money to fix the car so it sat unused until this spring. This spring I decided it was a good time to get the car running again, and it would crank, but not turnover. We removed the battery, trickle charged it, and could still not get the car started. This winter was much colder than usual, we decided the battery might need topping off, it did appear to be low in several of the ports, after refilling and another trickle charge, still no luck. At this point, still under the assumption that the battery could be the issue, we purchased a new battery for the car. With a new battery, the car is still cranking but not turning over.
	This May, after doing some more tinkering, we discover that we can get the car started by removing the air filter and applying starter fluid directly into the air intake. We successfully get the car to run for between 5-10 minutes with the help of the starter fluid. At this point, my brother who is more mechanically minded than me believes the issue lies somewhere in the fuel system, possibly the fuel filter or fuel pump. We also discover a significant amount of oil in the spark plug tubes. Valve cover gasket, spark plugs,  and spark plug tubes were replaced about five years ago.
	 Late May, we decide to have the car towed to a mechanic. I explain the problem and the steps we've taken as well as I can to the mechanic and receive a quote for a fuel pump replacement. After two days the mechanic calls and tells me I have a bad distributor and it will need to be replaced. I pick up the car, it runs, and I drive it home (about 10 minutes) without incident. Two days later, I take the car to run some errands, and it dies at a stoplight and cranks but will not turnover. I push the car into a parking lot and prepare to call for a tow. After around 30 minutes we try to start the car again on a whim and it starts right up. I manage to get the car home. I call the mechanic and describe the problem. He recommends I continue driving and keep a log of start times, issues, etc. He tells me he cannot diagnose this problem unless the car is in a no-start state when he receives it, that he can't do anything about it while the car is running. 
	At this point, I'm feeling pretty doubtful about the whole situation; operating a vehicle that is likely to stop randomly seems dangerous and irresponsible. After paying for new distributor I am essentially broke and can not afford additional tows out of pocket or additional diagnosis and repairs. The car sits for a week, I decide to just let it run in the driveway, time it, and see what happens. After running for about 5 minutes, I decide it's probably worth putting some fresh gas in the car. There is a gas station about a mile up the road and I get the car there and fill the tank without incident. After pulling away from the meter and driving probably 300-500 ft., the car dies completely at the stoplight and cranks but will not turnover. I push the car back into the parking lot and am unable to start the car again. That evening I have the car towed back to my house.
	After another trickle charge, the car now starts up just fine, but I am very hesitant to take it on the road again. I am out of tows on my insurance for the foreseeable future and I don't have the money to pay for towing out of pocket for now. At this point I kind of feel like I'd be better off just selling this car and saving up for a new(er) car rather than pouring more money into this one. I would love to be able to fix this car but I have no idea where to start and I'm not sure I can afford to go chasing down 1000 different possible issues. Posting here in the hopes that I can narrow it down to a few possibilities. Any and all recommendations / advice / suggestions would be very much appreciated. Thanks for reading.
	
TL:DR; Oil leaking into spark plug tubes. (not sure if related) Car was cranking but not turning over, got it to start with starting fluid, towed to mechanic, mechanic replaced distributor, car is now stalling at stoplights, cranking but not turning over. Eventually starts again after 30-60 minutes. Limited funds.
Please let me know if there's anything I've left out and I will add it to my post.

"Can you help me understand automatic transmission ""no flush for life""?
**EDIT:** I posted this here because i know this is a good subreddit for guys who *UNDERSTAND* cars, not just people who can work on them, if you would like me to repost elsewhere I would be happy to do so.
I understand that the transmission is a sealed unit, and is not exposed to combustion events so i can see why service intervals on some transmissions are 30K-100K.
But for LIFE? Oil breaks down, it goes though countless hot-cold cycles, and is exposed to some serious friction and shear forces.
Bearings, friction disks, solenoids, and gears all still wear (right?) and leave behind minerals and microscopic debris in the oil.
How an such a complex, high-wear component truly be service *free*?"
"2002 Subaru Impreza WRX Trailing Arm Bracket Breaking Off. Prognosis?
I have a rather rusty 2002 Impreza WRX from the Midwest. The suspension has been on it's way out for some time now, so I took it to a shop yesterday. Once they got it up on the lift we found the trailing arm is coming loose. Something has clearly broken off because the turning the nuts causes the bolts holding the trailing arm to the frame to **also** spin. ""The only thing holding it in place is the strut and *mechanic points to stuff* this right here"".
They said it's not the kind of thing they can fix. They said an auto body shop may be able to cut out bad parts and weld in new material. The shop mechanic's advice was to just drive the car till it won't go anymore. i.e. not put any more money into the car. 
However, my situation is complicated by the fact I'm going back to school (a 1500 mile drive) in 10 days, August 4. I don't want to break down halfway there with a carload of stuff and find it's too expensive to fix. 
I don't have any photos (I'll try to take some every time my car goes on a lift in the future). 
Ultimately I just want a second (third, fourth, etc.) opinion on the situation: 
Do I scramble to get rid of the car and find something safe for the drive back to the Midwest? 
Do I pursue a repair? 
Or just drive it back to the Midwest and try to get a different car once I'm there?
Please ask questions and correct me if any of my terminology is wrong."
"How to get maximum life out of my ultra high mileage 2005 Toyota Matrix XR?
I drive a 2005 Toyota Matrix XR with 280,000 miles on it. It still runs like a champ and I have no mechanical issues with it. I run regular maintenance and keep everything up to date. Only negative thing I've noticed is that lately it seems to take about a half a second longer to start up while turning the key. Only engine code that comes up is that the catalytic converter needs replaced. It is my daily driver and I run up about 30-40 city miles on it daily. 
A few questions that I have:
What steps can I take to make sure this car lasts to it's fullest potential? 
 How many miles do you think I could run it up to before it dies? 
If and when my car does eventually break down for good, what is usually the source of the problem that makes high mileage cars no longer useable? "
"Purposefully tuning a carburetor to make a car run really badly
Hey guys,
So I'm sure this is not a typical question but here goes.  Some friends and I want to shoot a parody Halloween video that makes fun of horror movie cliches, and we want to do a scene where the peoples' car breaks down on a dark road while they're trying to get away.  We're using a friend's car for this (1974 Plymouth Scamp 318 V8).  It has a newish Edelbrock carb and runs great (I actually helped install the carb).  I want to detune the carb so the car runs pretty badly (sputtering, stalling, hard to start, flooded engine sound, etc.) for the scene.
     
I have a bit of mechanical experience on old cars but I've never intentionally fucked up a carburetor, so I was wondering if there was anything simple I could tweak quickly to get those affects.  Ideally, I'd like to be able to drive the car out to the shooting location, tweak it, and then restore functionality back so we can drive home safely.
     
Thanks"
"I think an auto shop took advantage of me?
Hey guys, I'm not sure if this is the right spot to put this, but I'm looking for some advice. 
I am female, 22, and obviously not very knowledgable with cars
Last week I took my 2008 Chevrolet Malibu into the shop to get my check engine light read, do an oil change, and rotate my tires. Before taking my car in, I only noticed there was a problem with getting up to speed (it didn't take off as fast as it could have). 
The shop had told me it was my catalytic converter, it was going to be $1500 for everything (oil change, parts, labor, diagnostics). I paid it, and then took my car back in three days later because they had to special order the pieces. 
When I got my car back on Thursday night, everything was fine until I hit a bump in the road and there was a loud knocking/clanking noise for my engine. I freaked out because I thought they didn't tighten a piece of my engine down and called them when I got home. They told be to bring it back in the next day and they would take a look at it for free (the catalytic converter pretty much took up all of my free money so I'm absolutely broke right now). 
I bring it back in Friday and they called me four hours later saying it was my front caliper pins and that they were loose and they probably needed to be replaced. I told him I had absolutely no problems with a knocking noise from my engine before I took it in and they told me it's going to be $250 to fix and that rotating my tires didn't do this to my car. 
I honestly feel like my car could break down at any moment and a more serious problem could arise which obviously I can't afford. There's knocking when I turn sometimes, when I go over speed bumps, bumps in the road, and even sometimes when I'm just going straight. I am so afraid to drive my car right now, and this whole situation just doesn't feel right to me. 
My question is did they take advantage of me? Can rotating the tires cause the caliper pins to come loose? Is there a possibility that they loosened the pieces to get more out of me? Or could this just be a freak coincidence? And should I find a new shop to repair the knocking noise at or just take it back to them? My grandma is going to help pay for it but I don't want any more problems to come up. 
**UPDATE**
So I took my car into a shop that my friend from work recommended and the guys told me the calipers wouldn't make a banging noise. They instantly stopped what they were doing and tried to debunk what was wrong with my car. They lifted it up, took the tires off, tried to see if anything was wrong with my brakes or my rotors or any part of that system and they said everything looks perfect and my caliper pins were perfectly ok. 
Next, we took it on a road test and they confirmed what I was hearing and it seemed like it only did the noise over bumps and when turning my car right. We took it back to the shop and they lifted my car up again and looked at everything and noticed my engine was moving a little bit too much. They looked at the motor mount and noticed that it was broke and confirmed by shaking the tires that it was really loose/broke (which the other shop probably did while putting in my new catalytic converter). They ordered a front and a back motor mount and we are going to see if it's the right part today (8/25), and if so, they are going to replace the back one and then do the front when the other piece comes in on Thursday. 
They also said that I paid too much for my catalytic converter and that they'd help me with the costs of my car since I got fucked over pretty badly by the other shop.
**Tl;dr**: The other shop was trying to take advantage of me and we found out it was my motor mount that was causing the noise."
"I'm looking to buy my first car, and I need advice!
Hello Reddit!
First off, you guys and gals are awesome! This subbreddit is super rad, and I can tell you all love what you do. 
Anyways, I'm sure many of you have been in my place as a broke college kid looking for your first car. I've been looking around on Craigslist, but I really don't know enough about cars to go forward with any confidence, and I thought maybe you all could help me out.
First off, my budget is around $2000, which isn't a lot, but it's what I got. 
Next, I want something that will not break down (obviously), and is at least somewhat easy to work on, seeing as I have essentially zero mechanical skills. I am planning on a big trip around the western US at the end of the summer, so something that could last at least that long.
I have also been fantasizing about pseudo-living in my car for the summer, so a van or truck that would allow me to throw down a pad in the back would be awesome. This one isn't necessary, as I also love camping, just more of a dream.
With all this in mind, I have been looking at a few things on Craigslist, but I'm not sure if they are any good. What do you all think of these options? Or is there a different car that you think would work for me? I'm really open to all options. 
Here is a 1993 Chevy S-10 I've been looking at. Some mechanical problems, but the owner is super open about it, which a rarity for Craigslist I have found.

"Mystery Car Problem.... please help
2001 Dodge Ram Van 1500. Currently, has 38k miles. I bought it last September with 26k. 
This may be overly detailed but I just want to give you fullest picture possible. Essentially, something is wrong or going wrong in my van. I live in it and am often in remote areas. I really want to get this fixed before I get stranded in a remote area but no mechanic has been able to tell me what's wrong. I'll explain everything that's happened with all details but I don't know a lot about cars so some details might not be relevant. 
I bought the van in September and used it as a daily driver thru January with no problems. Only minor issue was that sometimes it was really hard to shift out of park. When I tried to shift it would just stop. I'd have to shift 5-10 times before it would move into reverse/drive. 
In January I left D.C and drove to southern VA. I had driven maybe three hours when I stopped at a gas station, filled up and walked around for a few minutes. I got back in the car and sat with it idling for a few mins. I put it into reverse and started backing out of a parking spot but as I was backing out the van just shut off. I rolled back into the spot in neutral, turned it off and back on. Ran fine and I went on my way. 
A few months later, I haven't had any issues since. I drive 2 hours to a fishing hole and spend the day there. Get back in the van drive 2 hours back. As I'm stopped at a red light just minutes from the house, the engine shuts off. I turn it off, back on and it runs fine.
Then a few weeks later, I'm driving around and the engine shuts off as I'm pulling out into an intersection. Almost got t-boned. 
Last week I was in Texas. I turned the van on and let it idle for a bit. Then the idle got really rough, at one point the van was lurching forward, or trying to when I had my foot on the brake and it just shut off. Off, on, it runs fine.
This morning I got up and drove 30 mins to park at a lake. Hung out there for maybe an hour. Got back in and while I was leaving I was pressing the gas and nothing was happening. I thought the car died so I slowed down(very loud gravel) and the engine was still running. I stopped turned it off and on but the engine was still unresponsive to the gas pedal being pressed. I turned it off and on maybe three times. I finally began to move at a snail's pace. My pedal about half way down. All of the sudden it fixes itself and I'm moving down the road.
No check engine light, no other indicators. I've asked three mechanics in different states to look at it and all of them says it's in great shape. 
Obviously, something is wrong and I want to fix it before I break down. Thanks for your help. Feel free to ask if more info would be helpful."

"Question about pre purchase inspection
Just had a pre purchase inspection on a 2008 subaru wrx, at a 3rd party mechanic
biggest issue they said about it was the peddle assembly was broken, when you pushed down the clutch, the break went down with it a little bit. They told me it would be a 900 minimum fix, due to the labor of having to remove the whole dash to replace it.
I explained that to the dealer and they told me they would fix it, and wouldn't even have to take out the dash its an easy fix.

"To change tranny fluid or not to, this is a real question
Hey guys! I have a 2005 Volvo S60 R (AWD) with 86k on the clock. The transmission has never been touched. I asked my mechanic and he said it was lifetime fluid so not to touch it. But I know fluids will break down over time and over use. Would it be alright to change out the fluid? I do not want to risk my transmission slipping. I could also replace just half of the fluid to keep some friction material in and still get some newer stuff in. Any advice or opinions welcome!

"2006 Honda Civic EX Coupe Blown Head Gasket Possibly Worse
The Cars Background: I'm the second owner of this Civic, the first being my Dad. The car has 126,000 miles on it, the paint is in bad shape, no rust but clear coat is gone in many places otherwise the car is in great shape never had a single mechanical problem with it. This car has mainly interstate miles on it, it has done many 16+ hour drives in a day since my dad bought the car new.
Anyway to the problem, I was driving from Pensacola, FL to Jacksonville, FL with my wife and 2 dogs. Right out side of Lake City, FL I felt a small pop from under the hood and instantly had no power at all. I look down to see the oil light and electric lights on as well as the the temperature is maxed.
Got it towed to lake city Kingdom Tire to confirm my fears. they quoted me a base rate of $1600 as kind of a best case scenario.
My question here mainly is does anyone have a similar experience with a similar car? What did you do and did you regret it.
I don't want to make the mistake of sinking a bunch of money into a car that's realistically only worth $4k when its at 100%. Especially if its likely going to break again in another area.
Any advice at all would be deeply appreciated.

"My car is perfect in every way other than the fact it could kill me, or somone else!
Hey im a 20yo male and I drive a 1.8 Ford Focus 2002. 
The guy who did my MOT said it was one of the best Focus's he had ever seen (I guess he meant condition and performance). However occasionally when Im driving the MPH dial will drop to 0 while the revs stay up. 
I can still accelerate,break,reverse ect ect. everything is fine other than the dial. Sometimes it will pop back up after a minute but most of the time itl stay down and the engine will eventually just cut out. 
I can only describe the feeling as if you can imagine yourself driving at say 35mph and then going into 2nd gear and trying to accelerate (it pulls back as if somone just slammed on the breaks) and the power steering also fails, meaning its really hard to even control the car. 
Once this has happened if I turn off the ignition wait a couple of seconds and then turn it back on the car will start again but the dial will still be down. If I wait, say for a minute and start it up again, the dial will go back to normal. 
Iv called my mechanic several times to try and fix the issue and the only thing that he thought it could be would be the sensor of sorts (sorry I have no idea as it was my dad who dealt with it and hes away atm) He changed the sensor, but for a 2nd hand one. whilst I does seem to be doing it less, it still cocours from time to time making me constantly worrying about when it will happen next. 
Does anyone know what the problem could posslibly be?
Thanks a lot

"Mildly cursed Smart Car
Hi folks of /r/mechanicadvice,
I drive a Smart Car (Smart ForTwo 2003 600cc). I agree they look kinda silly, but they've got enough power to get me where I wanna be, and they drive like go-carts with a roof on them, brilliantly. 
However, Mine, which i bought a year ago, seems to be cursed. when we fix one thing, the next thing breaks. I've had braking, electrics, exhaust, turbo, wheels and spark plugs fixed over the past 6 months, I paid it's price again repairs. And now yesterday, it pulled another thing out of it's hat. My dad was in a rush and was going top speed (130 km/h in sixth gear at 3500 rpm), which it generally does without a problem. However, just as he went over a hil, it made a bunch of weird noises, and he lost all power, to the point he couldn't get it any faster than 90 km/h in fourth gear - fifth or sixth wasn't properly reachable at all. He crawled it off the highway, and as he slowed down he noticed that the whole care was vibrating and the engine seemed to be running weirdly. pulling up from the traffic lights was a giant pain - all power was gone. We suspect one of it's three cylinders isn't working, meaning it's running on two. 
We're gonna have a mechanic look at it by Tuesday (no idea how we're getting it there), but in the meantime I'm wondering if this car is any good at all. It's becoming very expensive like this, regardless of low taxes, insurance and fuel costs. Is there such a thing as a 'curse' - aka, is it possible that something might cause a car to keep breaking, or am I just having the worst of luck, and are chances i'll never have any problem with it again? 
It's my first car, I can't afford to keep repairing it. My dad said that there's a chance the car is a total loss anyways, if we have bad luck with this dead cylinder thing, since it'd require a full engine rebuild/overhaul. What would you guys advice me - should I get rid of it regardless, or is it just a matter of luck and doesn't it really matter? - if anything, I've got so many new components on this car, it should be worth more :p"
"Need some help identifying some problems under the hood.
I drive an '88 Ford Escort GL Wagon. I bought it for $800 and so far it has worked tremendously. Except, it overheats. I don't know too much about cars, especially not older models, but when I popped the hood I noticed the radiator coolant was very high (way beyond the ""hot"" indicator) and almost had a brownish look instead of a lime green. Could this be the source of my overheating problem? Also, when I'm on the road and the car shifts into second, it makes this really loud grinding noise. I'll record a video of it tomorrow and post it here to help anybody out. Third, I noticed the car seems to shake and vibrate quite a bit when I'm braking or driving on the highway. When I took it to the mechanic, he said my CV joint would need to be replaced, so replacing that may fix the issue but I'd like to know if there were any other causes to it.
Third, when I brake, it makes a very high pitched screech. I tried adding brake fluid but it doesn't seep through, just stays above the cap. Again, the mechanic said the brakes were in near-perfect condition so I'm not sure what is causing the noise or why the brake fluid won't go in. Lastly (I left this last because I believe it's the smallest issue), when I go accelerate and about to hit about 30 mph, it jolts pretty hard, makes the noise mentioned above, then keeps going like nothing happened. 
The overheating problem is about the biggest concern for me IMO because I'm on the highway a lot this week and don't want to break down on it in an unknown place. Any and all of your help is greatly appreciated and I hope none of these are too hard or expensive to fix!"

It also needs some things fixed but overall it is okay for me to drive but I do not want it to give up on me this year at least, since I could be missing classes and destroying my budget. Has anyone have experience with it? What parts break most often? How much on repairs is too much at this point for this car (I have around 500 for repairs)?

"2013 Hyundai Elantra - smoke and sputtering after routine service at dealer - am I being hosed?
So I took my car in to the dealer Saturday because the A/C stopped working and decided to have the ""spring special"" done on my car while they checked out the AC (oil change, tire rotation, checking breaks, belts, and hoses, checking battery, etc.).  
I come back to the dealer a few hours later, pick up my car, and not even 1/4 mile down the road from the dealer a bunch of white smoke is coming out of my tail pipe and the car is sort of sputtering, like it wants to stop.  I drive it immediately back to the dealer, explain what's going on and they take it back.  They gave me a loaner and said they'd look at it on Monday. (By the way, nothing even remotely like this happened before I brought it to the dealer.)
So the dealership mechanics called me and said they fixed it and it was just a buildup of fluid or something that got jarred when they did their spring service special and that the pipes need to be cleared more often. They said I should put foot down all the way on the gas the next time I am getting onto an on ramp to have all the right flaps open or something and clear the pipes or something. Something to that effect.  Is this a real thing?  I don't know if they're bullshitting me or covering up that they fucked something up.  Everyone I've told about this says it sounds like bullshit.

"1995 Camaro Remanufactuing
So my camaro's engine wasn't holding pressure, and there was bearing material in the oil. I was told I need a new engine, and the only route I could really take was to have the engine remanufactured. From what I was told, that basically means the engine is like new, since they bore it out enough for it to be basically new, and they put new internals in it. 
My questions are:
Will this fix the oil pressure issue?
Is there a likelihood of any other problems arising after I get the engine put in? 
How should I drive it when I get it back? (I've had people tell me that I can drive it however I want, others that say I should drive it like I stole it, and others that say I should baby it everywhere and not to drive too far for the first 500 miles or so.) 
The shop has already removed my engine and it's at the remanufactring shop, so basically I'm getting paranoid that it won't work properly, or that it'll break right after I get it back. It is the 3.4 and it's a manual. I'm pretty good around an engine, so no need to dumb it down for me."
"Advice for young 1986 G20 buyer
Hey all,
I'm looking for a reliable van at a low cost to do road trips and local driving in. I'm from NYC so I've been looking in fair weather states with no salt, well maintained, and stored well. I've had little mechanical experience, but I'm motivated to learn about proactive maintenance and I have a garage with the proper tools and some budget to do so. I've found a potentially promising van 15 hours from me. I'd fly down there to pick it up and have multiple cities with friends in each to crash at on the ride back if need be.
The van in question is the following
https://columbusga.craigslist.org/cto/d/1986-g20-van/6509556603.html
I got in pre-inspected today. The mechanic who did the inspection said that he would feel comfortable driving it to the west coast today without hesitation. He said it was probably sitting for a while recently, but it's been well maintained and run often enough on small trips.
He did the compression tests, 125/130/135 and it was good, said the coolant was very clean, no rust in the cooling system, there might be a leak in the trans or a tail stock seal (sp?), but he didn't seem to worried about that. I'd get that fixed after the 15 hour roadtrip back home, along with many other parts i've researched and you can find on my reddit history recently. Tires are just about new and not dry rotted, new serpentine belt. He said he wasn't able to use his lift to get under the vand and he didn't have those pits you drive over to get a good look under it. He crawled under it for a visual inspection, but wasn't able to check the rotors or breaks, but he said no rust down there. The mechanic drove it and said it was great. I asked multiple times if he'd feel safe driving it to NY and he said he'd trust driving it to the west coast without hesitation, he said it was very well maintained. He said it's a 1/2 ton which is better than 3/4 ton cause cheaper parts, 305 engine, he couldn't check the fuel pump for me cause he couldn't get under it to take it apart or something. I told him the price was $3k and he reacted as if it was definitely a good deal.
I have an experienced mechanic friend who agrees that this seems like a safe buy and he would also not hesitate to drive it 15 hours home. However, he's very familiar with potential issues that may present themselves on the road, how to troubleshoot them and how to fix them. Unfortunately I don't have the experience to troubleshoot engine/electronic/starter issues out on the road. I have a list of parts like the following which would save costs if i got broken down, but like i said, I'm not experienced enough to be able to troubleshoot and fix with them:
* Full set of english sockets/ratchets/extensions
* Full set of english wrenches
* New battery (possibly alternator, at that mileage and age I would think the original may not be the most dependable)
* New ICM (ignition control module) - these little bastards will just randomly go out, and leave you stranded.
* Ignition coil
* Distributor cap
* Carry a few quarts of engine oil and transmission fluid
* It doesn't seem to have a spare tire, so purchasing one right after you buy the van is a very, very good idea.
* Starter fluid, brake cleaner, PB Blaster, WD40
* Spare serpentine belt
I've seen that some of these parts are basic to replace, but I do not have the experience to troubleshoot which one of these are the problem, or something else entirely. If I had more time to prepare I could learn, but I'm not sure I do. I have a call tomorrow afternoon to speak with the mechanic who did the pre-inspection to ask any last questions. Does anyone have any advice or things I should ask? Also, Any questions for the seller?
I want to make sure I have a good shot at making it to nyc without a breakdown. Then after putting a few thousand into proactively replacing parts I would like to have a reliable van to do 3-hour road trips.
If I put in another $3k after the initial $3k to buy it sounds like I'd definitely have a reliable van to do 3-4 road trips with.
Please let me know your advice.
Thanks,
Burntshmurnt

Turns out the owner has been a big truck mechanic for the last 40 years, which makes sense why it was so well maintained. There's an 85% chance I'm going to go down and buy it in a couple weekends."

On September 14, I drove from Tennessee to Houston which is about a 13 hour drive. I drove 7 hours the first day and planned to drive 6 hours the second day. I spent the night in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. On the morning of the second day after driving 30 minutes, the car broke down displaying the message ""service transmission,"" and I couldn't accelerate anymore. So I got it towed to the nearest jeep dealership which is the same town I spent the night in (since it's rural Mississippi, it took a while for the tow truck to get there). I got a rental car and drove it to Houston. A week later, they told me my car is all fixed and ready to be picked up (it's a transmission issue so my warranty covered it). So on Saturday, I woke up early to drive 6 hours to get to Mississippi and picked up my car. After driving 40 minutes away from the town, my car broke down again with the same message. So I had to get it towed to the nearest dealership which is in Slidell, Louisiana. I had to get another rental car and drove 5 hours back to Houston (1 day wasted and I didn't even get my car back). Then it took the 2nd dealership 2 weeks to even diagnose my car (I called almost everyday begging them to fix my car but their excuse is they're behind schedule), and today they called me saying that they checked with Chrysler and couldn't figure out what the problem is, so they didn't fix it. Chrysler told them to clear the error message and ask me to pick up the car and drive the car until the message shows up again. I called my case manager and asked her to ship the car to Houston for me because
1. I already drove 12 hour round trip back and forth to pick up my car only to have it breakdown again. This is the 2nd time it broke down.
2. They didn't fix my car, not even the 2nd time it breaks down after sitting on their lot for 2 weeks and it's very likely that it'll break down again once I go and pick it up and attempt to drive it back to Houston.
The case manager says they can probably ship it to Houston but that would mean they wouldn't reimburse for my car rental despite warranty covers it because they're only allowed to give ""one goodwill"" per customer, which is ridiculous because it's not even a goodwill- I'm asking for them to ship the car to Houston because I'm not comfortable driving long distance in that car when they didn't even fix the problem and 2. I already drove 6 hours to pick it up only for it to breakdown again and had to get another rental car and drove 5 hours back to Houston. Obviously, I also need to get my car rental reimbursed because it's their fault it took them 3 weeks to get to my car (and didn't even fix it!). I'm a medical student so I'm in loans right now and can't afford to pay 3+ weeks of car rental.
So that's my dilemma. It's a long post so thanks for reading I feel really helpless and don't know what to do. I would really appreciate any advice."
"Door issue after leaving it at the body shop.
So basically I dropped my car off to get some body work done and mentioned in passing that the drivers door won't open from the inside, so they would need to wind the window down and open it from the outside just as an FYI. I literally said nothing more and hadn't mentioned it at any other time. 
With that being said, they had a look at it anyway and said the part for the handle had snapped so he had glued it and wrapped some zipties round so it will work if I'm gentle with it, but it will still need fixing in the long run. When I collected the car the outer door handle worked but the inner one didn't.  He said his colleague must've broken it when he moved it put of the shop.
I went home and the first time I had to use it, the outer handle now wouldn't work and I had to climb in from the other side. I tried the inside handle on the off chance again and it didn't work, but I felt something move. I tried the outer handle and it worked again.
So I went out for dinner as planned and when we got back to the car I tried again and rhe same thing happened.
My question is - where do I stand if the body shops make shift repair has actually worsened the issue to the point of it costing more? I never asked them to look at it and they did it all on their own initiative?
EDIT: the bit that snapped, the body shop overlapped and glued/ziptied together, rather than just glueing along the break. So because of that the cable wasn't retracting fully. No extra damage, it'll just be the cost of the original repair that needed doing. Thanks for all the help everyone!
Thanks for all the help though guys :D"
"03 Corolla wheel getting hot - might not be brakes?
For a while now, the car has been shaking a bit more at highway speeds, but I didn't think anything of it as the car is getting older, and we have another car, so it doesn't get driven a great deal.
While driving probably a month ago, it really didn't feel right driving it, and when we got where we were going, there was an emergency brake stuck on type smell, and the wheel was really hot.  We drove it back home to determine what to do (more smell upon arrival).
My father was in town a week later, we jacked the car up, and took off the calliper, which moved fine, checked the brake pads, and they looked fine.  We cleaned everything up and put it back together.  Another drive around the block, same thing happened (smell and hot wheel).
It has been sitting in the driveway every since, as I've been really busy.
He mentioned that it *might* be the wheel bearing, as we had replaced that one 4 years ago.  This reminded me about some clicking sounds when making hard right turns (drivers side is the problem) going into roundabouts by my house, but hadn't heard any other bad bearing type sounds.
Is it possible that a bad wheel bearing is making the wheel get this hot without already catastrophically failing?
Would the wheel bearing overheating make the emergency brake left on smell?
Could this still be a brake problem?
Is it safe to drive the ~11km to the shop taking breaks to let the wheel cool down?"
"EPC & check engine idiot lights with transmission issues. 2006 VW Jetta 2.5L automatic
My car: 
2006 VW Jetta 2.5L
Value edition
Automatic transmission
80k miles
Vehicle history:
No accidents.
I'm the second owner.
Coolant issue fixed by first owner.
Torn CV boot (unfixed).
Vacuum pump issue causing a mild oil leak, no dripping (unfixed).
Burned/dirty oil when bought, changed about 4k miles ago.
Burned/dirty tranny fluid, changed 2k miles ago.
Speedometer off by 5mph.
Clock runs a bit fast (probably irrelevant).
Current issues:
Originally the transmission slipped occasionally when driving slowly. It behaves like it's in neutral for a moment before it gets back in gear.
Recently lost cruise control, EPC light went on at the same time.
After losing cruise, engine starts weird. It took a few extra turns to get going and the check engine light came on.
Transmission became clunky, not smooth. Slipping got way worse.
When I noticed the transmission issue I took it to the local German auto shop. That's where the burned tranny fluid was discovered. The guy told me changing it probably wouldn't fix it, but I got it anyway. It didn't fix it. I went to the dealership and they took it for a drive and told me it needed a whole new transmission, $2200 repair. I decided I would just wait till it breaks down entirely if it needs to be replaced entirely.
Couple thousand miles later I lose cruise and have the issues described earlier.
Is it possible the transmission was originally acting up because of an electronic power control (EPC) issue before the light went on? If so, does that mean I don't need a whole new tranny? Could the burned fluid be a sign of or cause irreparable damage? Are there any steps I can take to diagnose or even fix the issue?
I hope this isn't too much to read. I appreciate any advice, corrections, or comments, even if you don't have an answer. Thanks in advance!"
"2002 Subaru Impreza WRX. Over heating/ slow mechanic
Hey thanks for reading. I bought a WRX with about 80k on a swapped motor in May(ish)2015 . The previous owner lied about timing belt and I bent the valves after it broke. Shame on me for believing a random car guy. I fix them with brand news heads, water pump, all major parts that should be serviced externally. After a while of it being in the shop my radiator drain plug breaks and I overheat and blow head gaskets. Shame on me again for not watching the gauge. So I have new head gaskets put on and get the car back. *CX Racing radiator installed* The car is still over heating from the shop (very reputable). I dropped it off in mid November of '15 again after explaining the overheating isnt fixed and they can't figure out why my car is over heating. I replaced thermostat twice, temp sensor once, combustion test, compression test, radiator bc the replacement was cheap eBay I figured it was just faulty. Symptoms are blown head gaskets but no evidence and seeing that they're brand new *note they tore down motor again and put newer head gaskets in to make sure* As of now they are still trying to find out why. All work now is under warranty by them. Only mods I have are 3 inch turbo back, Invidia n1 muffler, grimmspeed electronic boost control, grimmspeed internal waste gate bracket, up-pipe/external waste gate, larger turbo from newer model STI, STI top mount intercooler, 650cc injectors, 255 fuel pump. (Pump Gas)Also I'm running a speed density tune. As of now I stopped by the shop to pick up old heads for another project I'm entertaining. The car is on the rack and they tell me they're still diagnosing. Im impatient in general. Should I just sit on my hands and wait or do you guys think me wanting speedy results are justified?

"Drill bit stuck in brake rotor screw
 
Doing front pads & rotors on my 09 Honda Accord EX-L V6. Rotor screws are a nightmare!
Managed to get rotors off one side without too much issue. For the passenger side, decided to just drill them out. Unfortunately I had drill bits break off in both screws. I was able to get the rotor off, but the outer rim of the screw head and the bits are stuck in and I can't replace the screws. Tried getting them out with some pliers, but no luck. I've heard I could just file them down and go without the screws, and am worried that if I want to replace the screws I may have to replace the hub. Looking for advice on how to handle this, and I'd really like to put my car back soon :)

"My car has become a wimp, it dies for no reason! Please help, details inside.
Car details: Daewoo
Nubira 1999,
X Series
1.6L Auto
140,000km
Recent fixes include the **entire fuel line**, grounding line on battery, engine head replacement, timing belt, oil changes, water in battery & radiator. I've also tried all the different purities of fuel (making sure to use it a few times in a row, as to completely flush the system out of the previous)
So with that out the way. I purchased this car as a cheap light use vehicle and it worked a charm. Its never been thrashed (over 3.8k rpm), overheated, been above 120km/hr or any other negligent nonsense.
About 8 months ago the engine started to die going up large hills (when I used to power over them, albeit slowly). I get down to about ~30km/hr and then it feels like all power leaves the accelerator, unless I absolutely floor it which forces the engine to drop a gear and it sort of works. The moment I slow down any further the engine starts to shudder something awful, and if I push it any further, it dies (with the engine and oil light coming on concurrently. 
It was sporadic at first but over time became more and more common to the point it happens every single time, and not just on hills, but when I start the car (in 8 degree or 38 degree temperature) and drive down perfectly flat road and attempt to get past 50km/hr.
I've spent about $900 in the past month to try and fix this otherwise great car, but having it break down 100% of the time in the first 5 minutes of use, or going at any hill almost makes it unusable.
I've had 2 mechanics & an auto electrician (he only checked the vehicles logs to see if a sensor was tripping, and replaced said grounding lead) go over the vehicle to no avail.
To re-iterate. Engine just ""feels"" weak, dies going up hills or in the first 5 minutes of use (engine shuddering before death), oil and check engine light come on, lose power steering (obviously). Give the car 15 seconds and start again, works 90% of the time. 
If anybody has any insight at all, I would appreciate it beyond belief if you could share it, buying a new car would devastate me at this point. If you need any other information please just ask.
Thank you for your help!
EDIT: Going to bed right now, please leave any more ideas or questions you have below, again thanks for all the help so far guys."
"My friend's car's electric window is broken. I think its the regulator, but theres one thing that makes me unsure.
My friend's drivers side window has stopped working. She said that when it broke there was a crunching/grinding sound. Now when she tries the switch the motor sounds like its working but the window doesn't move.
I've done some online research and with my limited knowledge of cars I've come to think that the regulator is broken. All the signs are pointing to it except for that the window wont move up or down when I try to force it with my hands. It's only open about half an inch at the top, but when I tried to force it closed all the way it wouldn't move up or down, just a little rocking side to side. The videos I've seen explain that you should be able to move the window freely when the regulator breaks.
Anyone have experience with this? Any thoughts or input would be awesome. Thanks! "
"07 Toyota Yaris - I screwed up, I don't know what to do.
Well, I bought my first car on the last day of November from a local used lot with good reviews. Being a new driver, buying/insuring a new car was out of the question financially and I thought that going through a dealership would allow for less chance of buying a seriously damaged car. I was wrong.
I don't know anything about cars, and my dad passed away when I was a kid so my big reference for car knowledge is gone, but I did a lot of research and brought a 'used car checklist' with me, running through it and checking for leaks, common problems. I thought I did everything I could - I turned down multiple cars, saved for months, checked everything, and I still screwed up. Everyone keeps telling me not to beat myself up because these things happen, but I still feel duped and cheated.
The car is an 07 Toyota Yaris 2DR hatchback automatic. Got a clean Car Fax with it, and they said they did a ""140 point safety inspection"" on the vehicle and that everything was good to go. But my mechanic says there's ""no way"" i could have damaged the transmission to this point in the time I've owned it, and that I likely bought it with a bad transmission.
I bought my car for $4000 3 months ago. I have driven it about 2700 miles total. I replaced an ignition coil last month (my mechanic said the spark plugs looked like the originals, he replaced them all), then I brought it in because I noticed two things: a little rattle when I was idling and a kind of grinding/whirring noise when I slowed down. Well, he checked it out and found that the rattling was from a part of the exhaust that would be $1000 to replace. And the grinding was... the transmission :( I got a quote for $1500 to replace the tranny with a used one (77k miles), and $3000 to rebuild it. Plus the $1000 part in the exhaust. Plus the $300 for the ignition coil/plugs, the total cost of this car will be ~$8,500. And that's just to get it on the road again, presumably for another few months before it breaks again.
I took it back to the dealership yesterday, because they were ""doing me a favor"" by looking at it. I'm assuming they're going to offer me a trade in, probably something ridiculously low. And I know that the dealership is probably off the hook for all of this, because I was just an idiot who trusted them. And I'm just wondering - what should I do? I feel incredibly hopeless. It seems like no matter what, I'm losing thousands of dollars. I just want to know what the best path forward is.
I'm sorry if this breaks the ""rip off"" rule - I'm not trying to! I just can't believe this is happening and I don't know what to do.
PS - I know that I screwed up and should have known everything about transmissions before I bought my car, but it's a lot to learn and I tried my best.
TL;DR - I bought my car 3 months ago, drove it 2700 miles, now the transmission needs replacing/rebuilding, about $4300 worth of repairs. Dealership is 'doing me a favor' looking at it, but I don't know what to do from here. Fix it? Trade it? Abandon my car ownership attempt altogether and walk everywhere forever? Help
(edited to ad TLDR)
UPDATE: I called the dealership and they offered to split the cost with me 50/50 and cut down on labor, so a new (used, 80k miles) transmission, installation, new fluid and axle seal will be $650. :) I'm not thrilled that the transmission is out, but I am thrilled that the dealership is helping, even a little. It looks like I can keep my $4000 investment, at least for a little while longer. Thanks everyone for your help! I consider this a happy ending. 
I guess the lesson is: always have a mechanic check out your car ASAP AND if something goes wrong anyway, see if the dealership will help you out. And you can catch more flies with honey, so try being nice first. It's a long shot, but possible, that they'll help you out."
"My first car and first project
tl;dr where can I get a 1979 toyota corolla SR5 liftback(TE51) repair/shop manual cheap or free     
    
Hi I'm new to this sub so excuse me if I break etiquette.    
    
I just bought my very first car(I'm 18) but have been fiddling with cars and engines for a while. I bought a 1979 Toyota corolla lift-back SR5, which is totally awesome BTW. It does not move on the account of not having a transmission but the engine starts and runs but badly needs a carburetor tuning as well as suspension and brakes need help (the engine is the original block but was taken out and put back in after a rebuild and since has done 79,000 miles but the chassis has over 700,000 miles on it.    
    
I plan on restomoding the car but without proper documentation I have no idea what things need to be torqued down to etc. When I got the car it was idiling at 3,000rpm which I have since adjusted down to 1,000 but i believe the car factory new idled around 800 but I have no idea. anyways where is the best place to get a manual (i.e. cheapest)?    
    
also I may start posting about it on /r/Justrolledintotheshop because the car aside from the engine was completely neglected. So far all I did was clean the trunk out,fixed the doors squeaking,idle speed down to 1,000rpm from 3k, and adjust throttle linkage. the journey begins!"
"Manual transmission slop?
I’m experiencing some weirdness with my car (2004 Mini Cooper S), what I can best describe as slop or slack in the drivetrain, and I’d really appreciate some help in tracking down where the problem is.
I recently changed my clutch/flywheel, as there was a knocking sound at idle that went away when the clutch was disengaged. This problem went away, but unfortunately the other symptom that I thought might be fixed by changing it did not, which is a noticeable jolt when braking and in gear, happens at about 1500 RPM. My car has a dual-mass flywheel, so I thought this might be the cause, but after replacing the flywheel, the symptom is still there.
After changing the clutch and getting past the break in period, there is now another noticeable issue of drivetrain slop, especially in stop and go traffic. When I let off the gas it feels like the somewhere in the drivetrain there is a lot of play, and the car yo-yos back and forth. It makes a slight gear noise as well when his happens.
Also, when I jack up one side of the car and leave it in gear, I can rotate one wheel back and forth about 2-3 inches while the other wheel is on the ground. I believe my car has an open diff. I’ve owned a few manual transmission cars and realize some play is normal, but this feels excessive.
I’ve posted on Mini forums and researched others experiencing this issue, and the most common suggestion is to replace the motor/transmission mounts. However, I just had those out as I was replacing the clutch and they didn’t seem bad at all, no torn rubber or anything.
The other possible issue I’ve read is the u-joints in the axles could be going, but I’m not sure how to verify that. When I rotate one wheel, it seems like the whole axle is moving all the way to to the transmission.
If it’s something in the transmission, like differential or something else, how would I verify that? Thanks in advance for reading this!"
"Clutch/ shifter worked fine prior to service...
I'll try to keep it sweet and simple:
Took my Volkswagen GTI 2012 in for 20k mile service (I have approx. 18k miles), covered under warranty, mentioning my air filter was musty.
Hours later, mechanic tells me his guy test drove it and noticed issues with the clutch, so he quotes me at $1.4k for parts and service (not covered under warranty). I THINK that the mechanic/tech may have damaged the shifter/ clutch accidentally, because clutch damage of this kind doesn't make sense to happen over night... in the hands of a dealership.
I decide to sleep on it and picked it up this morning, and noticed the shifter was stuck/defective, and not in the same condition as I left it (which was shifting just fine).
I break down at a Western Union that is less than a mile from the dealership (in a thunderstorm) due to the shifter giving out, and I request a tow back to the dealership. The manager, mechanic, and tech tell me that the issue must have happened as I dropped it off, coincidentally, and take no blame.
The tech/ concierge takes me for a test drive in the car so he can see for himself what is the issue. He notes that the shifter is inoperable for an average driver, and that the clutch may not be the issue. He also looked under the hood and noticed fluid on the transmission among other things that SHOULD have been caught during ""inspection"".
As the tech/ concierge shuttles me back home while they further investigate, he tells me that the issue may not even be the clutch, I ask why they assumed it was and gave me the suggested Bill of Material, he replies that they could have done a better detailed inspection and they have their top technician now looking into it.
Not sure what to do at this point as far as getting my car to the drive-able condition that it was when I dropped it off for service... any thoughts? 
NOTE: I did NOT request the clutch to be looked at because there was no need to- everything worked/ drove just fine. 
TLDR; Dropped my car off for servicing in working condition, got it back with an inoperable shifter the next morning.
EDIT: They convinced me to call VW and tell them it was a defect (basically to make VW pay for it instead of the Dealer). VW sent down one of their engineers to make sure it was a ""defect"" and they upgraded my clutch with a new one with a ""clutch bar""... not sure what it is, but I now have a new clutch for free. Thanks everyone for the insight!"
"2006 Tiburon, Idle issues - sporadic
Hello all. Sorry for all this wall of text, but its a big story to tell.
I recently had Dobbs replace my tiburon's spark plugs. When they did such, the car put a check engine light on. After 2 hours of investigating they said it was the Mass Airflow Sensor (MAF). They cleaned it and the light went away. 
Now with MLK day and a work from home day, i didn't drive the car, except to go home after Dobbs' work,  for a couple of days. Now the car sporadically will not hold idle and just die. 
I took it to Dobbs last night, thinking they screwed something else up when researching the check engine light. 
They said they found the issue, The Throttle position sensor (TPS) pigtail, and they suggest replacing the TPS sensor as well while we are in there.  
For them to do this work here is the break down cost:
TPS Pigtail : 37.95
TPS Sensor: 84.95
Labor: 57.00 
Total: $179 
They told me to test this, they had teh car running and would mess with the pigtail. This tells me it should be fairly easy accessible to do my self and when I looked up the parts on Advanced auto the Pigtail was only $7, and the sensor was $70! so at the cost savings per part and labor I would love to do this myself. Is this difficult? I have some knowledge of cars, probably enough to be dangerous, and have some mechanic type friends to help .
But my main question is, could Dobbs have broken these while researching the CEL? My friend says I should push back at Dobbs to replace for free, and right now its their word against mine. 
Second issue. They decided to test the MAF with a ""Quick Rev"" test, they said it was coming up as defective as well. They took the power it was recieving during this test and Dobbs measured 2.2Volts. Dobbs said it needed 4Volts.  Is there any way I can test this? I have replaced MAF before so I know its not that hard, but I don't want to spend the money if I don't have to. I can't tell if Dobbs should be replacing this piece free of charge either. 
One thing that really makes me question Dobbs this time, as previously I let them do all the complicated work.  Is they said my air hose from my intake/air filter box to the throttle body was completely disconnected. Which they would of done at the time of spark plug replacement. 
I'm really looking for any advice on where to go next. Help me /r/MechanicAdvice, you're my only hope!"
"2008 Ford Focus Tire Pressure Sensor - ""It broke, sometimes it just happens and isn't our fault.""
Do tire pressure senors just break some times? My repair shop called and said that my sensor broke while changing my tires (taking off my snow tires - putting on new all season tires), and that it was $74 to replace. When I asked who was paying for the sensor they said they would check, but sometimes this just happens and isn't their fault.
Do they just break? Or are they just trying to get out of paying? He can be higher-priced, but provides me with generally very good service (picks my car up from work and returns it when it need to be repaired, once made a loop to tie down a kayak for me, rewired my 7-pin trailer wiring - twice, etc.).
Edit/Update: The sensor was a band sensor as /u/reboticon talks about. I ended up having to go to the shop because they didn't put my tires back in my car and the tire kid told me it was a band (and that he ""must have hit it"") and it will be replaced with a valve sensor. Also, 2 of the snow tires are now damaged. They have torn on the inside of the bead. Tire kid said he thought it was because they are put onto/take off of rims too often. These are the end of the snow tires 3rd winter.
I'm pretty sure that they caused the damage to the sensor... did they cause the damage to the tires too?"
"Flooded (with water for years) Diesel generator... where to go from here?
[Generic 3 cylinder diesel engine on a 12.5kw generator.]
So, I volunteer for a nonprofit, and we recently took possession of a 106 year old fishing boat. It was in service, and retired from fishing in august of 2012. 
In late 2012, the ship was prepped for long-term storage, 3500 gallons of diesel was brought onboard, oil was changed, everything was done right...
Except...
No one covered the generator exhaust stack. For whatever reason, nearly every fishing boat around has stacks that point skyward, and this one was facing the ever present Seattle rain since late 2012.
Anyhow, the way the boat sat (with a minor list to the starboard side)  caused all of the rainwater that fell down the stack to collect on the starboard side, where the 12.5kw generator sits... (The 25kw generator is on the port side, and is running perfectly fine.)
Last december, during the transfer inspections, we found that the engine for the 12.5kw generator would not turn over, and I thought that it may be hydrolocked due to the oil level in the sump being twice as high as it should have been...
I was right that the engine was hydrolocked... I hoped it was diesel leaking through the fuel pump over the years, but as you probably guessed, it wasn't.
Today, I pulled the fuel rail off, pulled out the injectors, and sucked water out of the cylinders. I checked with a mirror, and things don't look too nice in there. I filled the cylinders with Marvel Mystery Oil, let it sit for an hour and tried to turn the engine by hand (with the injectors out). I couldn't get it to budge, even with a 2' ratchet handle.
I didn't drain the sump oil, but I'm expecting to find about 5 quarts of water, and 5 quarts of oil. (Capacity is 5 quarts oil, and the oil level on the dipstick is basically to the point where the dipstick comes out of the engine block.)
So, Here's where things stand...
There was rainwater in 2 of the 3 cylinders for about 4 years. 
The rain water leaked down into the oil sump.
The water likely reached the level of the crankshaft. 
The water I sucked out of the cylinder was crystal clear (no rust).
The cylinders are still full of Marvel Mystery Oil as of right now, and in a week or two, I'm going to go back, drain the crankcase oil, put in some fresh, and try to turn it by hand again.
Here's my question:
How fucked do you think it is? Do you think that trying to get it unseized by soaking the cylinders is likely to work, or am I looking at a top-end rebuild at a minimum? If I do break it free, am I likely to do additional damage to the cylinder walls / piston rings, etc. or is pretty much everything fucked, and I might as well give it a try...?
TL;DR: Diesel engine sat for 4+ years with water in 2 of 3 combustion chambers, and in the oil sump. How fucked am I, and how likely am I to make it even more fucked by trying to break the rust free without disassembling and rebuilding the engine?"
"Chevy right rear tire locking up while leaving driveway.

It's a 1996 GMC Yukon, with a 700r4 and NP207 TC. 10 bolt one wheel wonder rear end, havent looked up ratio yet. It's got some decent options for that year, CD, Leather, and whatnot. 
Our shop just dropped a low mile 350 from a 99' in it, runs strong.
Last note, I've been under it quite a bit, the tire carrier has corrosion, but no real rust, and the floorboard behind the back seat is in great shape, no holes or starting rust. Same with the doors, rockers and all that. 
I am aware of the fuel economy of these vehicles, so with that aside, does anybody have anything noteworthy for me to help guide my decision? 
Im eager to hear what you all think, for example, things that seem to break on all of them, issues owners have after owning them for awhile. Things of that nature. "
"Need help/advice - 1996 Buick Century cooling system
Hey all.  Needing some help/advice here.  Bought a 1996 Buick Century Special (V6), 45,000 original miles, classic ""old lady"" car.  I've been using it on my rural mail route (80 miles 450 stops per day) since I bought it about six weeks ago.  Everything is looking good.  Until yesterday.Pop the hood to check the oil, and the coolant overflow tank looks like someone dumped about a quart of oil in it.  I check the oil weekly, and I would have noticed it before.  I checked the oil hot and cold, and it is fine, no chocolate milk, no unusual smell.  I haven't looked in the radiator itself yet though.I've read online that antifreeze can ""break down"" and take on an oil-like appearance.  I've got no experience with this though.  Money being tight, I'm going to pray that this is the case vs a head gasket leak or warped/cracked head and flush the cooling system.My question:  Is there an additive/detergent I need to flush with, or do I just cycle water until it comes out relatively clear?  "
"Just bought a 1995 bronco XLT for $4500, what needs to be checked/fixed first?
It has an 8inch lift (suspension and body), has 15 inch rims with 37's. I know I need to get it re geared and tuned up but how much will this cost? I'm only 18 and make minimal wage. I just want better gas mileage and for it to not break down anytime soon. I'm currently paying $100+ a week in gas and it's getting out of hand. The truck definetly struggles with stock gears on such huge tires and hardly makes it up inclines. Might put a Chip in it if it's worth it?
[Edit]: Let me clarify that the reason I wanna do regearing is to take off the amount of drag and lugging my engine is having to do. It feels bogged down "
"Should I change my rotors myself or get a mechanic to?
I got a service and tune, and was told I would need new rear rotors and pads so I went down and bought rear rotors and break pads that were half price, rang a few places and found out they have changed some law or something about not being able to use customers parts for some reason. I have some mechanical skills, and really don't want to have to pay for new ones again. Is this something I could do myself or is it worth just paying for the parts again?"
"Cam break in advice.
So I've got a 2003 Land Rover Discovery that I'm putting a new cam and set of lifters in. I've got the initial 25 minute break in down pat. I'm curious about the post break in period. I've heard really mixed feeling on whether the vehicle should be driven hard or driven easily after the initial break in. Does it actually matter that much? All Google will tell me is how to prevent my house from being broken into. 
Thanks!"
"01 Dakota, Had to Macgyver a clutch job - how long will it last?
Well me and my bud finally got around to doing the clutch on his Dakota, that I posted about here a few months ago (thanks for the help BTW). It's got the 4.7 motor and the NV3500 5-speed tranny. 
Well we had some unforseen issues with the install that we ultimately decided to Macgyver because the friggin truck is only worth about $500-1000. Honestly he said he'd be happy if he gets only 40-50k more miles out of the clutch since we saved a ton of money doing it ourselves. But we're still wondering if the stuff we did could reduce its lifespan.
So the original pilot bearing was completely fucked, rollers all over, no grease, can't even call it a bearing anymore as much as a bunch of pieces of metal. After getting that out (which took a few friggin hours), I saw that the bore was damaged, it wasn't a smooth circle, it had some scoring and marks running around it. The input shaft wasn't quite a circle either, it had heat marks and tiny portrusions of what looked like melted metal on it.  
So what we think happened is that the pilot bearing failed, and with no rollers for the input shaft to spin on, it began spinning the race itself in the bore, and the heat and friction caused it to expand and get stuck in the bore eventually, but not before scoring the inside of the bore. Then the input shaft kept spinning with no real bearing, and the friction caused some of the bent and broken rollers inside the race to weld themselves to the shaft. Just a hypothesis.
Anyway, we used emery cloth to sand down the input shaft and get it as circular as we possibly could. Then put the new pilot bearing in, and it spun in the bore. There was probably half a mm of play, you could spin the race with your finger. So I found the thinnest piece of metal I could find, a piece of copper from some gasket, cut it and bent it into a C shape and put that into the bore. That allowed the race to stay in place. So we put a few drops of red Loctite on the outside of the bearing, and on the inside of the bore, and the piece of copper, and forced the pilot bearing in there and it seemed pretty tight, had to lightly hammer it in to get it flush. Then put everything back together.
It seems to be OK but he's only driven the truck about 30 miles so far, and all at under 2.5k rpm because of the clutch break in period. So I guess the question is, what are the chances that this could catastrophically fail? Or will it be ok for awhile? Thanks buds."
"Car makes grinding sound while braking (Ford Focus C-Max 2004)
I have a 2004 Ford Focus C-Max and for a few weeks now it's been making a strange grinding noise when I break. The weird thing is that it only happens *sometimes*, not every time I brake. I find it hard to describe the sound so here is a video with **exactly** the same sound. [Video, should start at 1:05](https://youtu.be/rVljnHCMnaY?t=1m5s).
I live in a cold-climate country and we had some freezing weather the past two weeks (dropping down as low as -20C (-4F) at night).
 I had the car checked and diagnosed back in November and they found no problems, and they had informed that they'd checked the brakes and brake pads too, they were fine.
The comment on the video I linked says that it could be because it's frozen, and FYI, it's still around -1C (30F) right now.
It would help me greatly if you guys could shed some light on this problem.
Thanks!
UPDATE: I noticed that if I drive very slowly and accelerate slowly, the sound remains, and the intervals between sounds shorten as the speed increases. As if something is rubbing against the wheel or some rotating mechanism."
"New brake pads pressed against new rotor?
Hey guys,
Changing my brake pads and rotors, I don't think the last guy changed them at all; the old pads were worn down all the way to the metal. My question is, is it normal for the new rotor and pads to touch each other when you put the caliper back on the wheel with the new pads in it? I can still turn the rotor, but there's very obvious resistance against the pads. I'm changing my brake lines too and have them off so I can't use the pedal to change the piston position. I used a vice grip to move the piston as far in on both sides as I could, and this worked for the front calipers and rotors but not the rear. If the car is a rear wheel drive car, and the new brake pads are touching the rotor, do I assume correctly that just by driving around a bit the new pads and rotor will wear down enough to not touch each other? Should I just drive around for an hour or so with a lot of braking to break them in?"
"Extremely Squeaky Wheels
I have a 2007 Mitsubishi Eclipse.
I have had it for a year and it has been perfect until about 2 weeks ago.  While driving I turned down the stereo and I could hear a faint squealing sound.  It was a constant sound, so one long ""eeeeeeeeeeee"" when I sped up the sound would intensify, when I slowed down it would lessen.  One thing in particular was that whenever I tapped on the breaks the sound would stop until I released the brakes.
Some suggestions I have received are:
* Severely under inflated tires - I have checked and my front passenger tire keeps going flat after about an hour of driving and my rear left tire also goes flat, just a tad bit faster.  I try to make sure they are filled whenever they go down though.
* Needs new tires because they can squeal on turns, due to having a hard time gripping pavement - I have had these tires for a full year (not sure how long I need to change tires) but the threads look fine to me (again I'm not an expert)
Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!"
"Driving briefly with little to no oil
So I’m currently writing this in a gas station waiting for help. My oil light came on (the little red tin can) so I drove about a mile to a gas station where the yellow check engine light has now come on. I peak under the car and as you may have guessed, oil was leaking out. I didn’t hear any “knocking” as some people describe, the temperature gauge was still towards the middle, no “seizing” or smoke. Curious if that’s a good sign of no damage or not as I can’t afford it if I fucked up the engine.
Im not expert but I believe the nut/bolt that you usually undo to drain the oil wasn’t completely tightened. 
Edit: I also checked the metal dipstick thing which also didn’t have any oil if that helps
Update: Had someone bring out a jack and some basic tools. It’s not the drain plug. It’s leaking from the oil filter. Still troubleshooting with said persons help who knows more than I
Update 2: 
So it's been a long day but here's what happened. My dad got all the tools and had a look at the oil filter. Turns out it was the rubber O-ring/gasket. When I was changing the filter I forgot which notch the ring went on. I placed it one away from where it should have been and thought about double checking online but didn't think it'd cause this much of an issue. Lesson learned. Anyways, he patched it up and drove it home to get a ""feel"" as I finished the rest of his errands for him as payment. Oil light disappeared but check engine light remained. He had me disconnect the battery and reconnect it. The light has since disappeared. Did a 2 mile test run around the area and light is still off but there is a burnt odor outside the car. He told me this is normal given the situation as driving on the freeway oil got into and under places it normally shouldn't be. 
I've canceled my out of town trip and will probably do some light errands and driving to see if anything happens. If nothing arises this labor day weekend then I'll flair this as solved.
Today was a bigger dose of adult-ing than I'm used to so I'd like to thank everyone for their tips, knowledge, experiences, and words of support as it helped me get through this pretty rough day.
Update: So this past labor day weekend I canceled a trip with friends to a neighboring city and stayed home to do some work and run some errands. Drove about 120 miles in the 4 day weekend and everything seems to be okay. Not sure 120 miles means it's good or if it's gonna break down on me randomly. Seems to be running at 99%, I say 99 cause I'm a very paranoid person so not sure if it's in my head or I'm actually noticing something off. Anyways, thanks everyone again and if you have any advice for me about my situation after this feel free to message me (i would say comment but idk if the flair closes it, I lurk/comment more than I post)."
"2001 Ford Focus SE 2.0L Zetec Manual Transmission Issues
This video should help explain:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mdjicf6R2E
I bought this car yesterday and was trying to figure out some issues it had with the transmission, see if you guys could help me out pinpoint them.  :)
First issue is that while the shifter itself shifts fine, the shifter assembly moves about because the plastic base on the bottom that holds the shifter in place has two of the four plastic pieces that hold the shifter together broken.  I was wondering if there was somewhere I could get a replacement because I looked it up on RockAuto and couldn't find anything.  The bigger issue is that if the two other plastic pieces break then I can't shift.  Here's some pictures:
http://i.imgur.com/FmUv3VW.jpg
http://i.imgur.com/gQjoT2K.jpg
The other problem centers around the clutch pedal and possibly the clutch disengaging.  The clutch itself seems to be plenty fine because I put the car in 5th gear at 50MPH and pushed the accelerator all the way down and it didn't slip one bit.  When the car is in 1st gear you can hear the revs go down just fine but when you're moving and in all the other gears at any revs if you press the clutch you can go into another gear fine but you don't hear the car revving down like it should.  Anyone know what that could be?
Appreciate your help a lot.  :)"

"2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee making a noise
So I have a 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee that is making a weird noise when its coasting when not applying breaks or accelerating, it only does it when the speed drops under about 10mph the sound is a faith thud thud sound, almost like a flat tire (its not flat I've checked) it seems like it's coming from front wheel well. I have not been able to really get down and look at it because of an injury but I can if I try.
I do know I need new rotors, not in dire need of them but they are starting to warp a little, could this be the sound, or would it be something else?

"Lawn mower diagnosis help needed, please.
So, I'm not a total mechanical newb, but my lawnmower has quickly progressed to being the most hated thing I own. The mower is not old, roughly 2 years. Over that time I've changed the oil 2 or 3 times as well as cleaned the carby and replaced the air filter. Its a Briggs and Stratton powered Masport mower. It blows poop-loads of black smoke when running. It doesn't maintain a constant power, instead it revs up and down very quickly and has very little overall power (seriously, a small patch of clover will be too much for it and it'll die.) It starts fine (so, thinking spark/coil is ok?) but this massive lack of power is causing me to think it is fuel delivery? If I bump it into a wall while walking forward (ie, just getting the edge) that will be enough to cause it to stall also. Note it was left in the rain once, but that seemed to have no adverse affects at the time. 
Would be awesome to get some advice. Thanks in advance. 
**UPDATE:** Mower runs like a German built Lamborghini now!  
Many probs, in the end I cleaned carby (and bowl - see pics,) changed diaphragm and gasket (clear big leak in gasket,) replaced coil (I bought one a while back when I thought that was the problem,) new spark plug (the crap on the old one was unreal!) replaced the exhaust (had to break the old one to get it off, it was rooted.) Also did oil change and new blades.
No black smoke, easy to start, runs like a dream!

"Procedure for getting car on jack stands
I've grown up around cars, my dad always just used cinder blocks kicked under the edge of the vehicle and left the car on the jack.
I'm trying to be safer, use proper jack stands and all.  However I keep having issues.
I had an 88 Civic Hatchback with a 5"" clearance for the jack, which meant I had to buy a pretty small hydraulic jack.  It doesn't lift enough to get my Dodge Caravan onto the stands.
Here is my current procedure for rotating tires or doing break work that requires all 4 to be off the ground.
0. Put blocks behind the rear wheels.
1. Put two 6 foot long 4x4's on their side under the front of the car. 
2. Balance the jack on top of the 4x4's.
3. Jack it up as high as it will go. Hoping the jack doesn't roll off.
4. Slide the jack stands under the sides onto the jack points.
5. Release the jack.
6. Move the whole contraption to the back of the van and repeat.
7. Now my front wheels are back on the ground because my driveway is slightly tilted.
8. Move everything back to the front and Put more boards under the 4x4's and jack it up again.
9. Raise the jack stands.
At that point, all 4 wheels can come off.
Is there an easier way to do this?  It takes a good 30-40 minutes to get everything right and the same to get it back down."
"Calipers are sticking forcing the car to stop when driving at highways speeds. Been changed twice.
Okay so let me start off by saying I don't know much about cars, this is my first car. It is a 99 nissan sentra w. 1.6L.
Whenever I drove on the highway the car would feel hesitant to accelerate and if I let go of the gas (to press it again) it would abruptly stop and pull to try to speed up again, break pedal was stiff as hell where i would almost have to kick it so it would go down, but only moving it like half of an inch would make the car stop super fast.
Took it to pepboys where they told me my breakpads where gone, had those replaces along with two rotors and a caliper. Car's fine for 2 weeks. Same problem happens again, we take it back and they tell me its the OTHER caliper. Okay. One week rolls by and I have the same problem, only this time it had been raining the night before so I drove by a puddle and I saw there was ""smoke"" coming out. We park and we notice that my break pads/ rotors are red hot! we spilled a little bit of water to make sure and yup it starts sizzling and steaming. Took it back and they told me it was a manufacture error and that they had to change my rotors, break pads and calipers again (all under warranty this time) aaand wouldn't you know it this time same shit happens. I'm taking it back there cause it is still under warranty but what the hell is happening?
**Edit**
Okay so I just came back from Pep Boys.
They couldn't find anything wrong...with anything. The hoses are fine, the master cylinder is fine, the break booster is fine and all the parts they changed are still fine. We went on the highway and drove it, everything was fine. This problem seems to only happen when I drive it at 5AM which I dont see how it could possibly mean anything. So as for now I am the crazy lady that invents problems in her car. FML. Also, the fuck do I do if (when) this happens again?"
"How do I care for a 21-year old low-mileage car?
I bought my Infiniti G-20 new in 1994 and it is about to hit only 70,000 miles because I only use it for occasional errands and the odd road trip, so less than 2k miles per year recently.  In the last 1-5 years I have replaced the tires, headlamp bulbs, and exhaust manifold and I think I took it to Jiffy Lube once (but they are thieves and may or may not have replaced the fluids they claimed), and changed oil and oil filter about 3 times.  Muffler is heavily rusted (but still working) and the lowest fan setting on the A/C doesn't work but otherwise it operates fine.   Is there anything I should be doing maintenance-wise with such a car?  Are there parts that, after 21 years, simply break down with age I should be worried about?    Am I about to get stranded on some road trip?  If I can get another 10 years out of this car, I'd be happy to put, say, $1k into refurbishing it, but I just don't know if that's worth it or not.  Or if so, exactly what I should be refurbishing.

LN106R 3L 2.8 litre diesel engine. Regularly serviced every 5000k's, timing belt done every 100000, currently around 240000, serviced very recently. Compression tests, valve shim clearances checked, injectors overhauled at 200000. Turbo installed around 220000, max boost 10psi, max EGT kept under 550C / 1150F.
Driving home from work, under no load, cruising a 80kph, engine suddenly develops an audible ticking noise. Related to engine speed, but not at engine rpm. Has since quietened, but I can still identify it. No loss of engine power or oil pressure, still runs fine. Can only be heard above 1900rpm, easiest to hear under engine braking. Does not get worse with load, just faster with speed.
Another issue occurred at the same time which caused a break down, pinhole leak had developed in the fuel filter allowing the injector pump to suck air and starve causing shutdown. Replaced filter without issue, however tick remained. Unsure if related or coincidence.

"Steering sticking and seizing up. Very weird and sudden. Please help!
So, I'll start by saying that the car is a 2009 Mazda Mazda3 with 72K miles, and I have not been having ANY problems with the steering whatsoever.
So last night, I was leaving a friends house, and it's one of the ""warmer"" nights this winter (I live in Michigan, where we have been routinely getting negative temperatures all winter, and last night was about 20 degrees F). I start the car, put it in reverse, and go to start backing up. I go to turn the wheel, and it is completely stuck and will not move. Not like the power steering went out, I mean completely stuck and will not move more than a little bit in either direction. However, its not like its physically hitting the steering wheel lock either. So eventually, I give it a good hard tug in one direction, and it suddenly frees up, and is acting completely fine. I drove it home and everything seemed to be completely normal.
So, this morning I go to drive the car again, and same thing. It's completely stuck. I give a hard tug one direction, and it ""breaks free"", but this time it is not completely fine. The steering wheel was very ""sticky"", or in other words if I turned the wheel while driving down the road and then let go of the wheel, it would stay in that orientation (as opposed to straightening itself out. So I pull over, turn the wheel back and forth all of the way a couple of times, and it started working like normal.
So, the way it's acting, it seems like something in the steering assembly is like seizing up or something, and needs to be greased. Are there zerk fittings or lube points? and if so, where are they or how do I find out? Or is this some other sort of problem?
Mostly, I have to make it to work tomorrow, and if I have to drive it the way it is now is this very dangerous?? Could the steering wheel seize up while I'm driving???
I really really appreciate any help you guys can give me! Thanks in advance!!

"Pontiac G6 Overdrive problem?
I don't leave my small town a lot but just when I have these last three weeks my Pontiac g6 has suddenly been struggling at times.
I'll get to about 45 MPH and the car will suddenly stop accelerating no matter how hard I push on the pedal and after slightly varrying intervals the car will suddenly accelerate rapidly. Sometimes It won't occur until after I'm already going 60 Mph I'll drop down to 58 and when I go to speed back up the car won't accelerate. Sometimes It will just slowly drop back down towards 45/50. It even occurs while using cruise control my speed will drop down to 59 from 61 and when it tries to compensate it won't speed back up for about ten seconds and then suddenly the car is going 67 and then it puts the breaks on and it goes back down to 61 where it's set.
I've been told it occurs to my father at around 75 mph as well.
My mechanic cannot duplicate this and cannot find any problems or codes showing up.
This seems pretty serious to me just to play a waiting game until it get's worse and hopefully something pops up on the computer.
The car doesn't always do this on every trip at higher speeds but I'm unaware of any similar conditions between times it does.
As well recently my Service Air Bag light has begun to appear and the passenger airbag light will go off when it's triggered on screen. It's usually only when I have a passenger but I believe it may have once gone off when i didn't have one.

"2001 Ford Focus power steering issues.
2001 Ford Focus - 2.0 Liter DOHC -  Automatic - 220,000 miles
You guys were very helpful last week when I made [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicAdvice/comments/2posbi/my_2001_ford_focus_died_while_driving_this/) post about my alternator problems. Turns out it was the alternator, I replaced it myself last Thursday, and that is working great now. 
Now my issue is with my power steering pump.  I think I may have damaged something during the replacing of my alternator. In order to replace it, I had to move the coolant reservoir and the power steering reservoir out of the way. I also had to try and pull/push the alternator through a whole bunch of hoses and wires and different lines since it's so damn packed in there. There is definitely a chance that I could have damaged a line somewhere in the process because even though I tried to, I was not at all gentle while removing/installing the new alternator. 
So here's my symptoms/time line of events. Thursday night I replace the alternator, I get everything back together, start the car, and go under the hood to check voltage to make sure the new alternator is charging, it is, thank God! Then I notice a funny smell, and it looks like some type of fluid/liquid has been sprayed all over the underside of the hood. I check to see of I can see any leaks, I can't (to be honest it was very cold and late out and I didn't look extremely hard).  I also notice that my power steering pump is whining. I check the reservoir and it's low. I look again for leaks, didn't find anything dripping or spraying. I convinced myself that when I had the reservoir pushed out of the way, I had it sitting upside down kind of, and that most likely some fluid drained out of the cap/top and onto the belt or a pulley and when I started the engine it sprayed it everywhere. I didn't have any extra fluid so I drove up to the gas station. The car at this point is pretty whiny, it gets much louder when I turn, telling me the power steering fluid is low. I stop at the gas station the next day and top off my reservoir, honestly it wasn't even very low which concerns me. I drive the car quite a bit Friday, Saturday and Sunday. The steering is a little heavier than before, but everything feels pretty good except that it's annoying loud/whiny. 
Today I drive up to work (20 mile trip) go out to my car on breaks and sit in it as it idles (this is just where I spend my breaks listening to the radio). Nothing out of the ordinary as compared to the last few days. I drive home, get off the highway to my exit and come to a stop sign and smell a burning and notice that smoke is coming from under my hood. Not a ton, but definitely something is smoking. I pull over immediately, pop the hood and notice that fluid is spraying onto the exhaust headers (my exhaust shield thing corroded off).  I grab my bottle of drinking water from the car and pour it into the headers and it steams and the smoking goes away. I check for signs of leaks, it looks like the power steering pump is kind of wet. It's hard to tell though since it's raining out and I just poured water onto parts of the engine. 
I check the power steering pump reservoir and it's almost empty. I also notice that there is a rainbowy trail from the stop sign to where I'm parked (think drops of oil in puddles of water).  I get under the car, nothing is pouring out, which makes sense since it all probably leaked out/the car/pump are off. 
I let it cool for about 10 minutes, I'm only about half a mile from my apartment.  I fill the reservoir back up with what's left in the bottle from last Friday, start the car and head to my apartment. I had to hit a few stop signs/ lights and I was able to notice a little bit of smoke coming up again, luckily it was only about a 5 minutes drive home. By the time I get to my apartment all the fluid must have drained out because I have no power steering anymore, parallel parking was challenging. I park, pop the hood and check the reservoir, empty. It drained the whole bottle in under 5 minutes. There is also a trail of oil where I drove. 
So now there is an obvious major leak somewhere. I went up to my apartment to write this post and relax for a bit before I go take a look.  
Where would be common areas that the pump/ power steering system would leak? I just don't get why the power steering worked perfectly before I changed the alternator and immediately after I changed it it got all whiny and leaky. I must have damaged a hose or accidently loosened a fitting somewhere.  Any suggestions on what areas to check? Does anybody know of a good diagram that I can reference? I'm so sick of doing repairs to this car, and I really hope that I don't have to replace the power steering pump. I'm hoping that it's just a loose connection somewhere or a damaged hose that goes to the reservoir bottle. I don't have the time or resources for this repair right know and I need to get to work in the morning.  How damaging to the pump/car would it be if I drove it with no fluid?  I'm assuming that the pump would probably seize up and cause the belt to break? Then I would be stranded and definitely need to replace the pump/ a new belt?  Or would I be able to safely drive the vehicle 20 miles each way to work, just not have power steering? I think I know the answer to this, I'm just hoping I'm wrong.  Ugh. 
Any help would be greatly, greatly appreciated. I just wanted to come home from work and relax, looks like I'm going to be diving into more car repairs!  I will anxiously be awaiting responses and I will try/check what you guys suggest and will report back. 
Thanks. "
"2001 Nissan Sentra - noise after reversing
I have a long driveway and while reversing out of it (particularly if the car has been idle a day or two), I will hear a whiney/shrieky noise while the brake pedal is depressed in reverse, followed by a grinding sort of noise that seems to come from the right rear of the car, soon after putting it into drive.   Nothing is wrong that I can see.  The second noise goes away relatively quickly after getting into drive (after driving .25 miles or so) and then I don't hear it again until the next time I back out of the driveway after some period of not using the car.  If I have driven the car already that day or the day before, neither noise occurs at all.    I almost never use my parking brake (living in a very flat place), but something about it reminded me of a parking break not quite disengaged.  I feel like this car has worn its brakes more quickly than others I have owned.  Is it worth running something like this down, or not since the problem is so sporadic?"
"2006 GMC Canyon @ 125K miles - Rotor Replacement
I took my truck in today to get the brake pads replaced. The mechanic said I should also get the rotors replaced but that to replace the rotors, they would also have to replace the hub assembly. The total cost was going to be just under $1600. I was floored. They said it had to do with the way the ABS is implemented and that it was possible they'd be able to re-use the hub assembly but it's not likely.
Here's the break down of the estimate they gave me:  
Ceramic brake pads: $99  
Labor: $40  
Brake Rotors (2): $160  
Labor: $33  
ABS Front bearing & hub assembly (2): $606  
Labor: $540  
The pads and rotors were expected but the business with the hub assembly seems nuts to me. They gave me an estimate without replacing the hub assemblies and it had the same parts but basically the same grand total of labor. Can anyone confirm if this is a reasonable estimate? Do you know if it's true that the hub assembly should be replaced when the rotors are replaced?  
Thanks in advance."
"[x-post from /r/Autos] Bearings have failed twice, same wheel, within two months. What am I doing wrong?
Car: 1997 Ford Aspire 1.3L 4 Cylinder, 5 Speed Manual  
  
This is my first time visiting this subreddit. I hope I'm not in violation of any rules or etiquette. If so, I am happy to remove this. (Also, I did NOT intend this to become the novel that it has).   
  
---
  
I have an issue with the front passenger side wheel. I'm about to install the third set of wheel bearings, in just under 2 months. So I know something else is not right.  
  
This is the first time I've done wheel bearings, but I'm fairly handy under a car so hopefully it's not a ""common sense"" error. What I cannot figure out is what I'm doing wrong, so I'm hoping some kind soul(s) can help me out. This car is my daily driver to get me to work, and it goes about 90 miles a day. Without the car, I can't get to work, which means I can't support my family :(  
  
Here's what I've been doing:  
   1. Jack the car up on passenger side, put jack stand under car
   2. Remove the passenger wheel
   3. Remove spindle nut from CV axle
   4. Loosen and remove ball joint bolt that holds the ball joint onto the knuckle.
   5. Using a pry bar, push down the control arm/ball joint assembly to get clearance to pull the knuckle off the joint and the CV from the spindle.
   6. Now that the knuckle is separated from the ball joint, remove the caliper and rotor to expose the wheel hub.
   7.  From the back, use a screwdriver to pop out (if it doesn't just fall out in pieces) the inner bearing. Push out the wheel hub by feeding the screwdriver all the way through the center of the hub, where the handle of it will sit against the bearing and I can tap out the hub. 
   8. Now the hub is removed, with outer bearing and seal still attached.
   9. The inner bearing is free, sometimes the seal will remain on the end of the CV axle. 
   10. Remove the bearing and seal from the hub assembly. I have done this two ways, with a screwdriver and with a table vice. Since it's the old bearing I figure it does not matter if I break it more. 
  
Now this is where it differs. I don't have a press, so to put on the new bearings I've done it two different ways. The first time I used a wood block and a rubber mallet, and gently tapped the bearing onto the hub until it was seated. It lasted a month and a half.   
  
The second time - which I just did on Tuesday - I used some sand paper to smooth out the cylinder that the outer bearing goes on. It's not highly damaged, but had a little pitting around where the bearing goes, making it feel a little rough. After sanding it down I was able to press the bearing onto the hub relatively easy using my hands. I don't know if that's a bad sign or not. This bearing lasted two days.  
  
In both cases, I used the force of tightening down the spindle nut onto the CV to press the inner bearing into the back of the knuckle.
  
This morning on my way in to work, I started getting a bunch of noise from that wheel again.  
According to what I see online, I'm greasing the bearings appropriately and also putting grease inside the knuckle where the bearings spin. The inside of the knuckle acts as the race for the bearings, the races that come with the bearings are not used.  
  
I'm using Timken SET11 bearings, Timken seals, and Timken Hi-Temp Wheel Bearing Grease (red). So I'm not trying to go too cheap.  
  
I had my tires rotated and two new ones put onto the rear yesterday. While the car was on the lift I noticed the new bearing (one day old at that time) was not right - I had play in my wheel. The mechanic tightened the spindle nut further and a lot of the play went away. The tire seemed to have a lot more resistance (is it possible to overtighten the spindle nut?) than before, but at least for the drive home from the tire shop it drove much better. In fact, my brakes felt tighter than they did on my way TO the shop - which also confuses me as to what could cause that.  
  
This morning, I started getting the shake back. Starts around 30-40 MPH. Lots of shaking when I brake. Now, a constant squeaking that sounds very much like the bearings the first time they failed.  
  
What I'm suspecting:  
  
   1. I'm not pressing the bearings on correctly/fully. Maybe I need to remove the entire knuckle, remove the bearings, and use some kind of actual press to press the outer AND inner bearings onto it rather than rely on the force of tightening down the spindle to press on the inner?
   2. The minor wear on the inside of the wheel hub (that I smoothed out via sandpaper) is somehow causing it to fail. 
   3. I'm under/over torquing the spindle nut, either causing too much friction on the bearings causing them to break down or allowing movement in the wheel tangent to the rotation of the bearings, causing the shaking and eventually breaking down the bearing. 
  
Wheels aren't my thing - I can do brakes and CV's and basic stuff, but this is the first I'm messing with anything that requires me to break apart an assembly. It's entirely possible this is all my fault, but I can't identify where the fault lies at the moment. All I know is I drive 90 miles a day, due to family illness have missed a lot of work already, and something is causing this breakdown to occur.  
  
So, I defer to you gearheads. Can someone please educate me on what I'm doing wrong (and right), and what I should attempt next to get this thing fixed. I'm out of ideas, out of money now, and really hoping its not the hub itself. I can't find a new one ANYWHERE.  
  
Last, because I don't know if relevant or not, the other issues I know of that I will be fixing are the boots on my ball joints are bad (joints seem OK though, not seized or freely moving), and on the passenger side the castle nut on the outer tie rod end (I believe outer, the part the bolts to the knuckle) is stuck and wont completely tighten down. Oh, I just remembered another one. The part of my shift linkage that bolts to the side of the transmission (I think it's some kind of stabilizer bar or something) lost its bolt, so my shifting is funky - but that's not the issue just something I noticed when I took a look this morning after I got the car to my office).  
  
Now that I type all this out it really sounds bad, but I love this little car and it saves me a TON of money. Even with these repairs I am still in the green versus what I paid for gas in my Lincoln LS. 
  
Thank you for taking the time to read this novel of a post, and any input you may have is greatly appreciated. I fear losing my job as I'm not even sure how I'll get the car home tonight...
  
   
  
**TL;DR: Please read it for full details. I'm not a mechanic but do most of my own repairs. This one has me stuck and I fear I won't be able to get to work and lose my job.**

"I need advice on my 2005 peugeot 206
I was driving it on Christmas Eve when it broke down. Called the break down company and he thought it had went into limp mode and then on further inspection, he said my injector has gone. He tried a new coil pack in the car as well, which led him to believe it was the injector.
The garage where I get my car seen is (give or take) 8 miles from my house. The car can still run, though top speed is about 30mph now. Is it safe for me to drive the car to my garage?"
"All new brakes, now with grinding clunk after complete brake service
Hey everyone! Just got new brakes and rotors, front and back for my 2015 KIA Sportage. It is still doing a grinding clunky thing when I press the brake to stop. Especially noticeable trying to stop going down a hill. I feel like it's coming from the front.
Originally, I had to take my car to get safetied, and they wouldn't inspect it unless I put on new brakes. I talked them down to just the front, which they did that day and I made plans to get the rear done in the next week or so (now completed). But, the thing is, the car didn't make this noise before the service. No squeals, no clunks. Is it just something that has to be adjusted or do new pads have a break in period where they make weird sounds?
I have no idea, Im just a pizza_ho trying to get to work! 😂 Thanks all! "
"My first car/first car problem: 1997 Buick Lesabre Break problems?
So I managed to procure my first car. It's a 1997 buick lesabre in pretty decent shape. less than 70,000 miles on it. Recently I noticed that the break light on the dashboard is lit up and it makes a constant beeping sound. Soon after that I realized that I have to pressed down much more harder on the brakes than I have before. I talked to a few friends for advice and they told me that most likely I need to replace the break pads?
Not sure so I decided to come here and ask for some help. Any advice is welcome.

"Car doesn't like to go into first gear when slowing down/when break is pressed.
I have a 1994 Integra and though the car shifts just fine, sometimes when I am slowing down to go around a bend or after stopping at a red light, my car doesn't like to go into first gear. Now when I stop at a red light, I can fix it easily by letting go of the brake for a second and then it works fine. However, if I am looking up a hill, like I often do, it can be quite problematic. Same thing could be said to happen to the reverse, but its also fixed by simply letting go before reapplying the break. In a parking lot that is easy to do so no big deal. I am curious because I will often be slowing down on this particularly steep off-ramp and need to go into second or sometimes even first and it just doesn't let me. 
Any help would be appreciated!

"2014 WRX - Dealer installed short block overheated after less than 10 miles! PLEASE ADVISE!
About a month ago, my 2014 WRX developed engine knock. SHOCKER! After having it towed my local Subaru service department, their techs determined that the knock was a result of rod/bearing failure. Having kept the mileage fairly low \(45K\) I was still covered by the factory powertrain warranty \(5yr/60K\), and Subaru agreed to replace the short block and any other engine components that were either damaged or contaminated. I of course gave them the green light to begin repairs!
Fast forward a week, I receive confirmation that the new block has been installed and after a successful test drive by their tech, the car was ready to be picked up. So I head over to the dealership, chat briefly with the service department manager and advisor about break\-in procedure and 1,000 mile check\-up/oil change, then grab the keys and head on my way. I turn on the car and am greeted with the familiar boxer rumble and a smooth steady idle, and once the engine has had ample time to to warm up, I drive off.
Unfortunately, things quickly went south. After merging onto a nearby interstate, I notice the check engine light has turned on and then watch as the temperature gauge shoots up into the red. White smoke begins to billow out of my front end, and I immediately pull of to the side of the road and shut down the engine. Mind you, this was less than 10 miles from the dealership. I call the service department to alert them of my issue, and set up a tow from Subaru roadside assistance. Once the engine finally stopped smoking, I pop the hood and can see what appears to be coolant splattered everywhere with a small pool gathering in the splash guard.
2 1/2 hours later, I finally return to the service department in the passenger seat of a tow truck. The manager offers me a loaner car, and assures me I will receive a call when they determine the problem. I agree and again head on my way. As promised, the service department advisor calls me later that day and reports that a coolant hose clamp had failed, causing the engine to overheat and spray coolant. They reattached the hose and tightened the clamp, degreased the engine, added coolant, and after a taking test drive determined that everything was in working order, and again I could come pick up the car.
Now, here is why I write to you....Should I be concerned that irreparable damage was done to the new short block as a result of the overheating? Is it likely or possible that this would have negatively affected the longevity of the engine and may lead to premature failure? The service department advisor reminded me that they provide a 1 year warranty on all of their repairs, however, I worry that the integrity of the engine has been compromised. Should I accept their explanation? Should I demand further testing? Should I ask for another new short block? Am I overreacting? What should I do? Note, i've yet to return to pick up my car."
"Can you guys save me with this broken sunroof?
So, I'm about to be a dad for the first time and my gf and I don't have a ton of money.  She has a 99 jetta  (2 liter, gas, 120k miles) that unfortunately suffered lots of neglect from a previous owner, but it's gonna have to do until we can get her into a better vehicle. Like I said we have a baby on the way. So I've been working like a madman trying to get the car safe for after the baby is born. We took it to a German car specialist who was awesome and did tons of work at a great price (control arms, tie rods, ball joints, as well as thermostat and radiator flush, window actuator, and door tumbler lock and some other random electrical stuff that was causing random window roll downs and the car to die). I've done the oil and filter change, air filter,  deep headlight restoration with clear coat, fixed broken bulbs, etc. 
Yesterday when driving to the store to get my 2 pints of Ben & Jerry's that I ate in one sitting, I decided to open her sunroof like a genius (knowing that it's been broken) and it got stuck in the completely open position.  When I try to close it,  the motor starts to close it,  then gives up when it hits the stuck spot and retracts itself. After watching a YouTube video, I popped off the sunroof motor cover and tried cranking it manually with the hidden Allen wrench in that compartment.  It still feels kinda sketchy , like if I were to really keep cranking on it something might break.
My girlfriend told me that she thinks the rails (or track) has broken apart because the sunroof has been broken and at one point pieces of plastic actually fell in. I looked at the tracks and can confirm pieces have broken off. So I was hoping you guys could help me here as our baby is gonna be here in less than 2 weeks and we can't spend anymore money at the mechanic's right now (it also needs timing belt, water pump, and serpentine belt, but that's another story). Can anyone give advice on how to get it shut? Or even better,  what will I need to do to get it fully functional again?  Is it worth it? It would be nice to have it working again. Thanks

"Rust bucket of a Lexus. What on earth should I do?
I own a 2005 Lexus RX330 that I bought 1.5 years ago. It had 130K km (80K miles) on it at the time and it’s now at 170K km (100 K Miles). 
While I couldn’t be happier with the rest of the car, the underbody was an absolute rust bucket from the start (no I didn’t see this before buying). A few months ago, the transmission fluid radiator just fell off its bracket when the front base cover thing was opened for a repair. I just stuffed it back in and zip tied the cover in place. 
Similarly anything “small” is flaking off in large metal chunks. Miraculously the actual sections of metal that hold the seats (idk what you call them) seem to be barely rusted. 
I’m really worried that something might break off or require maintenance that can’t be done because everything is coming off. Eg: I wasn’t able to jack up the car today because there is no frame left on that side. It’s all rusted away. We lowered the jack before it did more damage. 
So far no major issues have cropped but do I :
Apply a drip oil spray twice a year and see what happens? 
Try to offload this while I can?
Should I be seriously concerned or am I over thinking this? What the hell do i do with this car? 
I’m a female, and nobody in my family knows cars at all. I know nothing either. I was a first time buyer, and I didn’t have anybody to help me. You wouldn’t be able to tell any of this from the exterior, she’s a beaut and she drives very nicely too. I spent 11K CAD in total and I just don’t want it to be money down the drain. I’d be happy if I can just drive it for another 3.5 years.

"2003 Honda Civic is destroying my will to live >.<
Late May: replaced brake pads, rotors, shoes, cleaned out breaks: $800
Early June: Transmission fluid change: $180
Timing belt and water pump, stabilizer links: $1000
End of July: AC Diagnostic: $200
Which leads me to today: I was supposed to bring in the car to replace the AC compressor ($1200), and she wouldn't start. The battery was done a year and a half ago, so pretty sure it isn't that. It turns over, just won't catch. And there is a bitter burning smell (I don't know the different burning car smells.. either electrical, oil, rubber, or metal... think that covers just about everything), and some smoke when I opened the hood (nearish the back). I know shit all about cars, but checked the oil (fine), and everything else looked more or less normal. So... I didn't get the AC fixed cause I couldn't get it to the shop. 
Google lead me to believe it could be pretty much anything (electrical, fuel, transmission, oil, fuses, starter, ignition switch, etc.). Not good with cars so I don't think I can really tinker with too much to self diagnose. 
The car was sort of free; $3000, but it was money my dad had saved for me as a kid. Financially I can handle an unexpected expense of about $1000/month (at the expense of paying down my student loans), and can dip into my line of credit if entirely necessary (done school, so no expenses there). 
So I guess my questions are:
1. Any idea what to expect the newest problem might be?
2. What would you do? Fix it and hope this is the last thing for awhile? Scrap it? Fix the latest problem and forget about having AC, at least till next year? The car is in good shape otherwise, body is great, never had any problems until recently. Most of the work except the AC and this newest thing is really just routine maintenance, so I don't think its really falling apart on me.  I live in a really sprawling city, and transit can be difficult. I'm walking distance from work and a grocery story, but otherwise travelling anywhere will suck a lot, and my family lives 3h away, so any visits are a long expensive train ride away. 
I learned to drive on this car, and I finally named her two months ago (Molly, short for Molasses, cause she's slow as fuck on hills), so I'm a little loath to part with her, but she's killing me a bit right now. Also, if necessary I'm sure I'd be approved for a loan if I wanted to get a new (5 year +) car, but I'd rather not take on more loans until I can get rid of my school loans unless absolutely necessary. 
So, yeah... Any thoughts? Sorry for all the rambling. 
Edit: Thanks for the suggestions everyone! I'll get it towed to the shop to see what the deal is. 
Also, the break price included drums, but I know I've over paid.
Edit number 2: so diagnosis is a seized AC compressor. Makes sense with my previous AC trouble. On the plus side, my tow guy recommended a mechanic that's supposed to be great and much more reasonable price wise. He's gonna give me more options than the dealer ever did; maybe even used parts which considering  the age of the car might be good. Hopefully this will be the start of a great mechanic - clueless owner relationship. 
Never in a million years would I have expected a broken AC to actually prevent the car from running.
Thanks for everyone's advice and suggestions :) biggest take away is a decent, reasonably priced mechanic which hopefully I've found."
"Need help choosing a vehicle with repairing in mind
Alright, so I'll preface this with the fact I'm not a massive vehicle enthusiast. I know my core principles and I've taken my fair share of trucks and cars apart with my dad down to the engine, so I know my basics.
I am, however, a computer mechanic, in that I make my living on taking apart, fixing, repairing, and modding computers/laptops.
I am looking for the Asus of vehicle lines. Some computers (cough*HP*cough*Macs*cough) are designed to be like breaking into fort knox in order to access the important stuff, and replacing parts on them are like pulling teeth. Also they use different screws for everything so its a pain putting it back together.
Then we have companies like Asus/Lenovo. Their computers come right apart nice and easy, they use the same screws for everything, their parts are built to last, and accessing even the most sensitive parts rarely takes anytime. They also often have hotswap bays and friends so doing something like swapping the hard drive takes like 5 seconds. As opposed to 5 minutes on an HP, or 15 minutes on a mac (*shudder*)
Want to replace the keyboard on a macbook pro? You have to take the ENTIRE computer apart and then take no less than ONE HUNDRED tiny screws out of the keyboard.
Want to swap the keyboard on an Asus laptop? Six screws. Done.
I am looking for the brand/line of vehicles like that. It would probably be designed with modding enthusiasts in mind, it comes apart easy, finding replacement parts isn't that hard, and one guy taking things apart and replacing parts is not a difficult task if he knows what he's doing.
It will be that vehicle that when it rolls into your shop you give a sigh of relief because you know its going to be an easy job, because this brand is designed to be easy to repair.
So, what brand/type/line of vehicle am I looking for here?
*note: I am not intending to mod the vehicle much if at all. I just want a vehicle I can easily fix on my own if it breaks without having to pull my hair out.
Edit: Looks like a Miata is what Im looking for based on the responses. Thank you all for the help.

"seized caliper
Hello! Looking for some advice on this one... 4 months ago I got a set of new break pads and discs fitted to my Mercedes 2013 A class. 
Around 1 month ago I noticed that there was a strange smell coming from the driver side wheel, warm alloy, reduced economy, pulling to one side slightly etc. 
I took it to another garage today and as I expected they said it was a seized caliper and asked when I got the new discs and breaks. I told them and they advised me that the other garage did not oil the pads.. I don't know if this is legit or they are just making that up. 
The garage that originally put on the discs and pads said they will fix it for a cost.
Tl;DR 
Is it a legit reason for a caliper to seize up because it wasn't cleaned and oiled? If so is the garage that fitted this responsible  for this 3 months down the line?"

Edit: Thank you all very much for all the advice. I appreciate it very much..

As much as I want to get the car started see how well it runs I will be taking a step back and slow down. Putting together advice from everyone I've decided to basically start from the fuel tank and work forward.

  *   Cleaning/replacing tank.
  *   Checking/replacing fuel line up to pump.
  *   Replacing pump.
  *   Checking/replacing fuel line from pump to filter.
  *   Replacing filter (This is something I'm still not sure how I'm going to do it if I can't find the same type of replacement).
  *   Checking/replacing fuel line from filter to carb.
  *   Rebuilding carburetor.
Once I have the carburetor off I feel like it might be a good opportunity to check the intake manifold. Make sure nothing has gotten down into it over the years.

Also, because of the amount of time this is going to take I'm going to fog the cylinders again, and using some anti-seize put the spark plugs back in. I'm guessing it will not be until next year when I get to that part of the system. Once I get to it I will do the following.

  *   Change oil and oil filter.
  *   Check the points and condenser on the distributor.
  *   Replace plug wires.
  *   Replace spark plugs.
  *   Before trying to start I will turn the engine over a few times without the plugs in to get oil moving to the appropriate areas.

Hopefully once all the work is done it won't take much to get the engine running. After that then I will address many of the other items brought up in the thread like brakes, coolant, etc...

I just brought home a '62 Ford Galaxie 500 * http://imgur.com/a/EP62hGM *. It has a V8 352-v2 in it. The people I bought it from said they don't believe it has run in 12+ years. They were unsure if would run or if it was locked up. This weekend I removed the spark plugs. 5, 6, 7, and 8 all came out very easily. 8 came out with a little oil on the threads. 1, 2, 3, and 4 took a little muscle to break loose, but once loose they all came out easily. I then tried to fog the cylinders (I used a can of Yamaha fogging oil) as best I could and then tried to turn the crank by hand. It moved with only a slight effort.

Questions below


My plan now

  *   Buy some new spark plugs. - Should I change the wires? The ones that are on it look in decent shape. * http://imgur.com/a/8KnelLn *
  *   Change the oil and oil filter. - Any suggestions for oil/oil filter?
  *   Change the fuel filter. - Do they make this type of filter anymore? * http://imgur.com/a/41CgrRp * If not what should I do/use in place of it besides just bypassing the old filter and putting one in line.
  *   The fuel tank sounds like it is currently empty. Should I be worried about any corrosion on the inside? Are there any steps I should take before putting fuel into the tank besides maybe some putting some Seafoam in it?
  *   Fog the cylinders again before trying to actually start it. - The Yamaha fogging oil was what I had on hand at the time. Would it be ok to use this again or is there something better that you can suggest?
  *   Any other advice or anything I missed in the above plan?

This is the first car for my wife and I and we want to make sure we're doing/learning everything correctly as we go. Thank you very much for your time and advice."
"2003 Audi Allroad Questions
Hi guys, so I've been looking for a car for my 16 year old son to drive and I've come across a 2003 Audi Allroad. The car is in almost immaculate condition both on the outside and inside. The car is fairly cheap at $5,100 and is being sold at a reputable dealership here where I live. The car has 108,xxx miles on it. My question pertains to the reliability of this car so if anyone has had experience with either working on this Audi or owning one I'd like to know if it is a good car mechanically and if it doesn't break down often. All help is appreciated, TIA."
"2005 Civic Ex electrical mystery: cursed rear left turn signal
Rear left turn signal bulbs burn out within minutes. License plate lights fade in and out when trunk is opened. Problem started (well, the turn signal) after rear left brake bulb and license plate bulbs were replaced. 
Long version:
I take my wonderful civic for an oil change yesterday and they tell me that my left brake light and plate lights are out. So I have the bulbs replaced and leave.
The first left turn I take blinker frequency is messed up, so I check and, yup, the rear turn light is out. So I go back to the shop.
Turns out they forgot to tell me that they suspect a wiring problem because when you open the trunk and kinda move it up and down, plate lights fade in and out. Well, that's just great, but it's like 8:30pm at this point and I've had a really long day, and I don't really care about the plate lights that much right this minute, so I am really hoping that they can just replace the turn signal bulbs and everything will be ok.
The tech takes out the bulbs and shows them to me: one is stained white on the inside and the other is blackish clear. Which, according to him, is another symptom of a wiring problem. He puts in two new bulbs anyway, we try the signal, it works, I leave. 
But within a few minutes it's not working again.
Now the car is back at the shop and (1) it's really easy to suspect that they broke something because I had no trouble with turn signals whatsoever in the three years that I owned the car (2) But How? How do you mess up the wiring by replacing a few bulbs? (3) If they didn't break anything, how does an underlying but silent problem get exposed by changing some bulbs? (4) If they really did brake it, how do I get them to not charge me for fixing it?
Also, anyone can point me to a circuit diagram online?
Edit: yes, that wiring harness thing was it.  Why it went right then is still a mystery, but I am just happy to have my left blinker back."
"Transmission and brake fluid on my Honda Fit?
I bought a 2013 Fit a few years back and took it in to the dealer when the oil reminder was at 5%. The service guy pointed out that I have around 30,128 miles on the car and that they recommended air filter changes and transmission fluids and brake fluids to be changed. 
I was okay with that, because I had bought one of those ""extended warrenties"" or whatever they sold me on after I bought the car. I don't pay for oil changes and (apparently) if anything breaks down they will fix it. 
Well, of course the warranty didn't cover the fluids or air filters. $340 when it was all said and done. Even though the salesman assured us that I was wouldn't pay a dime on any of this. 
I'm a little pissed that I got taken for a fool with this warranty thing and don't want to be fooled again by buying fluid and other shit I don't need. What would you all recommend?"
"1985 Impala won't staty
So this is a nightmare....I recently had a Nissan break down on me and was able to pick up a  1985 impala v6 on the cheap.  It ran for about a day before it wouldn't start.  I had a friend help me replace the plugs and after a jump the car started right up and ran for three days.  During that time the car seemed to run fine but would throw a check engine light after about ten minutes of driving and felt like it was losing power.  Now I'm back to the same situation.  I started it up and it ran for about five seconds before it died, it turns over and over and seems to want to fire during the start cycle but will not run.  Ive checked all the connections I can find and have cleaned as many as I can see.  I just tried a new coil with no luck, as the distributor cap looks new and has fresh bolts, and the plug wires look good. 
My thinking is perhaps the electrical system is short power, which is fouling the plugs?
 I'm OK with cars but this one is out of my expertise.  Any ideas? "
"Replaced fuel pressure regulator and now there's a knocking sound :(
Replaced a broken fpr and vacuum line only to start the car and now I've got a knocking sound, it sounds like a dull knock that changes with rpm's. I didn't run it long because it's still misfiring and the noise bothered me. 
How can a car that ran like a champ literally the same day, fluids all at good levels, just suddenly die at a redlight only to get it home and now I've got what is possibly a thrown rod :*(

"2009 Nissan Altima Won't Start
Brace yourselves; this is gonna be a lot of text. I will try to be as descriptive as I can.
A few days ago, probably Monday, my car wouldn't start. Sounded like a dead battery. (I have a history of battery problems in my old car, and my wife's car, so I'm familiar with the signs) I had left my GPS plugged in, and while that *shouldn't* be the case, I assumed it was. I called my boss for a jump-start. When he arrived, neither of us had cables (left mine in my wife's car) but it was observed that my battery was 5 years old, and should be replaced. Que ride to and from work in my bosses' car.
When I got home, I pulled out my battery, and got a new one. Same brand, same capacity, ""same battery."" I installed it, and discovered that the terminals on the battery were *slightly* smaller than on the old one; I couldn't tighten the negative clamp. The car started, however, so I was willing to let it lie until the next day. (my workplace has people who know cars, and has a wide selection of useful tools)
At about 0300 the next morning, I was woken by a police officer who indicated that my brake-lights were on. I went out, and fiddled a bit, and finally pulled the fuse for the break lights, and went to bed. I now believe that my battery died the prior day due to break lights being on for 12 hours or so. The next morning the car started, and I drove to work without break lights. (terrible idea - I don't recommend it)
At work, I used soda can material to form a shim or collar around the battery terminals. This made it possible to properly tighten the battery clamps.
I discovered that the piece of the brake pedal that presses on the break-light switch had broken off. (plastic-rubber plunder) I was able to replace it with a 5/16 bolt, 1/2 inch long. The ""holding-down-the-brake switch was similarly damaged, and similarly repaired. (note: in neither case was the switch itself damaged - only the projection that pressed it) I drove from work to the hardware store, where I bought the bolts and nuts. I installed them, and replaced the fuse for the brake-lights and drove home. I had no trouble with any of these trips.
Two hours after my return from the hardware store, my car wouldn't start, again showing signs of a dead battery. I have removed the shims, and did my best to tighten down the clamps. 
I have attempted to jump-start the car; no joy. It sounds like it wants to turn over, then doesn't. After one or two attempts, it does not respond at all.
Tomorrow, I will be taking the battery to be checked. It will either be replaced under warranty, or it will be verified good, and re-charged. I'm *hoping* that will fix everything.
Can anyone make any suggestions as to what to do if the new battery doesn't work?
EDIT: /u/MechMeister got it. Clamps not properly tightened. Sometimes I do dumb things.
Thanks for the help, everyone!"

"2008 Saturn Astra Car Problems
Hi there! Thanks in advance for any advice or reading this through. I appreciate any advice or experience you can offer! I have limited car knowledge, but I am proactively researching what I can. 
&nbsp;
My car is a 2008 Saturn Astra, has 4 doors and hatchback. I think that's the XE version? I believe it's 4 cylinder. Has about 70k miles on it. Oil change not due on it yet. Check engine light is on right now (and sometimes it'll go on, later off, and turn on once more when it struggles - not flashing tho)
&nbsp;
It's been having random poor acceleration/power issues. It's like it lost it's pick up pep going from gear to gear as I accelerate. Sometimes have to press down harder on gas and it's like it's 'stuck', I feel like something is clogged maybe? In the past, I tried putting seafoam and premium gas in it, which in the past helped. 
&nbsp;
Now a new issue came up where the car is shaking in idle and clearly struggling to get accelerated up. Sounds dreadful at stoplights and when I go to accelerate it feels like it might just die out on me (but has not). Seems to struggle the most in idle and going from 1-2nd gear. I hope this makes sense..
Yesterday is when the shaking started, so I brought my car to nearby Autozone for quick diagnostic check. It has some errors going on, the main one being some kind of misfire on cylinder 4 detected - they said I need that addressed the most. (code: P0304 and P0008, there's a few others apparently that might be as a result of the misfire they said) 
&nbsp;
For the moment, I got more seafoam and premium put in, but the shaking is new/abnormal, and it didn't have any misfire issue codes before... so I know it's definitely a sick car.
When I did a little research online last night, it appears the other error has something to do with the camshaft. Possibly a dirty sensor or clogged screen or something of that sort (see [here](http://www.motor.com/newsletters/20130603/WebFiles/SS7_Saturn.html), a lot of the issues I'm having is described) I don't know for sure so just listing this as help with what the car is doing.
&nbsp;
Has anyone had this problem? What would, in your advice/opinion, cause this? I want to be informed as I'm bringing it to a shop tomorrow hopefully. I'm still trying to even REACH a shop to get it in to be seen. I'm nervous about all this.
&nbsp;
**EDIT:** I have a 10:30 appt tomorrow to get the CEL checked out/inspection. I hope to have more info about what they say, and will update here soon as I can. 
&nbsp;
**EDIT 2:** Update. I've just now gotten back from the car repair shop. It took awhile to get the diagnostic actually taken care of, mostly it sat in the air on the lift while people chatted around back at the desk :/ Anyway, not too thrilled with the results. As you suspected, it is marked down for spark plugs and the coil. I thought okay, let's try about the plugs first. When I tried to ask about replacing the spark plugs first, they continued reading down the invoice, and I hear the word Platinum. They weren't interested in changing the spark plugs to test things. I look at this invoice closer and noticed the word Platinum before spark plug. I said, ah are these are for 100k ones (am I wrong on that?) I asked how long they last to check, they said 50k miles. Which is odd, because I thought I read 100k for platinum? So I then asked, what was in my car then?.. Because isn't copper the 25k and this 100k? They confirmed mine were 25k ones. Okayyy. So then because money IS tight, I inquired about getting the coil and paying for the labour fees, instead. Immediate no. Like. Nastily said, no. It bothers me they would just put me down for the most expensive ones without asking or explaining. 
&nbsp;
Fine, I was definitely not letting them touch my car further. I had to pay about 50$ and not a thing was done. Sigh. As I've come to expect, I feel taken advantage of and pretty unhappy that had I not come here, I would not have been informed enough to know how badly this invoice got. The entire total of this invoice was $909.23 - YES. Insane. Outside of the spark plug/coil things it's including some light that went out (just on the drive there) and an unrelated $47.50 labor to apparently ""secure the heat shield"" better, whatever that is... happy to list the actual invoice, if you want to see. (edited for formatting) The charge for the coil would have been $641.43!!! Only says ignition coil, some product code next to it as 047-242 IC696.
**Update:** I contacted the store about the overall pisspoor experience after sitting on it, and the manager refunded the cost of the diagnostic. I appreciate that gesture, because truly they are bad and should feel bad, but I would never go back there for service. In fact, I will do most of my repairs for maintenance from this moment forward. :/
&nbsp;
**EDIT 3: UPDATE Sept 14th, 2015, repaired car. HOORAY!**
in comment below, but posting here as well! So what happened with mine (and apologies for not updating this immediately) is that I ended up changing the spark plugs, one of the camshaft sensors, and finally the ignition coil. The minute I put the coil in as the last step & started it up, it stops shaking and causing acceleration issues. Magic. I don't know if this meant it was ultimately ONLY the coil, a combo of the plugs and coil, and/or also the camshaft, but I feel like perhaps I did not NEED this camshaft replacement after all. The full shaking & problems didn't stop until the coil went in, if that helps narrow it down. Oh well. One less worry for future? xD 
&nbsp;
I got one that fits our type car off Amazon for a lil under $50, although wish it was Prime as the shipping took the full predicted time: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00UACSC6M?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00[1]
Remove the red inner cap before attempting to put the connector back in (don't be like me and try that, freak out it's wrong, then realize there was a silly inner cap LOL...)
&nbsp;
I did have misfire btw coming up as an error, as well as several errors as a result of the misfire. From everything I read or know it's probably one of those things: coil/plug/sensor. The coil + plugs will come in under 100$, so nothing insane. Take it to Autozone or somewhere that does the freebie quick diagnostic to get your codes. If you have a similar issues and codes coming up, and are comfortable doing some tinkering on your car on your own - start with spark plugs (gapped or gap yourself), then coil, and only after that, consider to do the sensor. It is priciest of them all, and there's 2 by the way. I only did the one near the bank that was misfiring. 
&nbsp;
Everything has ceased for me, the sluggish acceleration, the shaking, the shitty engine noise in general. It is back in order as of this weekend when I finally got the part in. I did **all** of these repairs myself, and I don't know much about cars. So have no fear, you can do it too! I just had to buy a few cheap missing tools, small packet of grease from counter, and a kind man lent me some in the moment. If you are in a bind, check with an auto parts store like that, there may be someone willing to walk out with you and let you unscrew the battery or whatever tool you're missing.
&nbsp;
One last tip: I believe the spark plugs I got were not gapped, and the awesome person at the parts store did it for me (I'm sure that was a lucky break) so be careful if you don't buy them pre-gapped or know how to gap, that you will need that done before putting them in. Just a warning there. What saved my arse this go-around pretty much was the nice kindness of others in helping me out when I was clearly struggling to do things on my own. I think in seeing that i was determined to learn and to fix the problem, they were willing to help on borrowing the tools or on the plugs. I did a lot of the other stuff myself. YAY for humanity.

"Odd Window Regulator/Switch Issue
Hello everyone,
I drive a 1998 Nissan 200SX and the windows started being a little wonky on me over the weekend.  First I noticed the passenger side window not respond to the button click immediately.  This went on for a few hours until it refused to go up anymore.  We managed to inch it up till there was about 3 inches left till the top, which is where it stayed.  Funny thing is the window can still go down, which happened the next morning when my roommate got in and unknowingly slid it all the way down while I yelped.  It won't go back up.   Broken switch I thought, no big deal. 
But the next morning my driver side window would not roll down.  I can hear the motor try to push it up, but since it's all the way up, it won't go.  I can also hear the passenger window motor try to go down, but alas it's all the way down and cannot go further.  But I cannot hear the driver side motor attempt to go down, nor the passenger side motor attempt to go up.  It's like these button clicks don't register.  So opposite sides, opposite directions (up/down) not working.  Right after that, my power door locks starting acting wonky.  The driver side can open the locks, but cannot lock them.  The passenger side can open/close just fine.
I checked fuses and they look fine.  The relays I'm not sure how to tell if they are broken or not.  But it seems weird to me that these switches seemed to...degrade...and not break completely as if a fuse blew.  The sunroof still works, but as of now the passenger window is stuck down and the driver window is stuck up.  This is a 2 door so only two windows.
Advice? 
Edit: Crap, sorry, forgot to put make/model in the title. "
"DIY inductive spark pickup for oscilloscope. Didn't know where else to put this.
Over the weekend, I finally had to break down and figure out some ignition stuff on my 4Runner.  That wasn't the problem but, I figured I'd share what I learned, anyway, since it may help somebody in the future.
If you have a dual trace oscilloscope, you can troubleshoot your ignition with some easy-to-build components.
Ghetto method: Wrap a strip of tinfoil around your 1 spark plug wire and put a clothes pin around it to secure it.  Wrap another strip around the coil wire and put another clothes pin around it to secure it.
Attach the oscope leads to the tinfoil and the ground clip to engine ground.  Set the oscope to trigger on the 1 spark plug and adjust the timing until all cylinders are visible.  You don't really need to display the 1 spark plug. Just shift it offscreen.
Less ghetto method: saw two 1"" copper pipe segments horizontally.  Solder a clip onto one side of each pair half.  Wrap the copper pipe halves around the 1 spark and another around the coil.  Electrical tape to make sure they're secure and to ensure that the copper halves are touching each other.
The copper pipes gave a much cleaner signal than the tin-foil wrap.
I found instructions online that said that I should wrap the electrical-taped pipes with tinfoil to prevent signal bleed from the other spark wires but, I didn't notice a difference between the 'shielded' pipe and non-shielded.
On the scope, you can see idle misfires resulting from no spark and snap misfires resulting from no fuel (bad mixture) and, if you've done it properly, you can see which cylinder it is.
Good luck."
"1991 E30 325i vert automatic, split second dip/bog upon initial throttle input only at low rPM?
First off, the car has new wires and plugs as of last December, also has a new fuel pressure regulator, new fuel tank (no clue about pump but I assume new) and new fuel filter.
The car runs smooth and pulls hard at speed but there is a strange issue where when the car is in park it will almost sound like it is about to stall out upon the initial little blip of throttle.
It's not a constant rpm drop for a few seconds like some other people describe it's more like if you are at a stop sign/light and you take your foot off the break and punch the gas to accelerate if you don't do it gradually the first gulp of air it takes in bogs the engine down to where it sounds like its going to stall out(only fraction of a second like the time it takes for the butterfly valve open and close again). It actually does stall out sometimes when it's driven it into the garage which has a little hump at the entrance, because of the extra load at low rpm(regardless if in drive or reverse).
If the car is in park and I manually pull on the throttle just a little blip it bogs/hesitates. If you apply constant throttle, or once above idle RPM it revs happily, its just that very small blip of throttle that causes the bog(can constistantly recreate the hesitation but only at idle rpm). This won't happen if the throttle is quickly pressed at above idle RPM only when below 1k type of thing.
Side note: The ICV (idle control valve, t shaped one) doesn't buzz /vibrate when the key is on. It also has zero effect on the idle regardless if it's plugged in or unplugged. It is a used unit and the PO thinks it is the reason for long cranking starts. Thanks."
"3rd broken belt on Miata
I bought my 2000 Miata 2 years ago with 80,000 miles on it. It ran great for 8 months. One night the serpentine belt broke. Mom and pop shop replaced the battery and belt. 500 miles later the belt squeaks a little and breaks again. A different shop checked it out and said everything was fine and sometimes you just have a bad belt. 900 miles later driving to work the belt breaks again. 
The only common thing that i can think of is the car isn't my daily driver so it's usually nice weather with the top down when I'm driving it. The last 2 times the belt broke it was cool and I had the heat running.

"2003 Hyundai elantra has a noise coming from a single rear wheel.
So I was driving my car today and I noticed a noise coming from my driver side rear tire. The car has disc brakes all around, but its only the driver side rear that is making noise. I jacked the wheel up and spun it and it sounded like the noise was coming from the brake pad itself scraping on the rotor. The car has had ABS problems in the past, and I'm wondering if its possible for a rear abs sensor to cause a problem with the break pads default disengaged distance. The rubbing is very mild, car does not pull in either direction on the highway or slow down significantly while coasting. My other thought is that somehow road salt or some various other material got in between the pad and rotor. My current plan is to just drive the car and hope that the pad wears down slightly and the noise stops, however if its the abs sensor that's a more complicated fix that would need to be remedied. If anyone has any experience in this type of situation ide appreciate it. Thanks."
"Is there any way to safely force my door open? (2007 Toyota Yaris Hatchback)
EDIT: I should specify this is the passenger front door lock.
I'll make this short and sweet.  Two weeks ago my lock actuator went bad.  The entire thing is in a sealed unit, no access to the lock aside from the cable.  The lever to open the door will not work because the actuator thinks it's locked.  I magically got my door to open one day and quickly took apart the actuator, cleaned it, and put it back in (lots of dust) but it immediately stopped working again.  The door will NOT open now.  At all.  No moving part accessible from the inside or out with relation to the lock will get the door to unlock.
Is there ANY way to get this door open without wrecking my frame or door itself?  I could care less about the actuator, I bought a replacement that seems to work awesomely (and at this rate, I'd rather bungie my door than no have it) I just need to get my door open.  The actuator can't be removed without having the door open (unless I break all the plastic and do a manual override on it being secured to the door... tempting, but I would like to try to put the electronic parts into the new actuator and this could damage them)
The striker bar bolts are outward facing as well, so I believe I wouldn't be able to remove it from behind.  It's only a plastic mechanism so I'm getting incredibly tempted to just pry it open...
UPDATE-
Alright, so I grabbed a massive pair of pliers and just crushed the mechanism, taking chunks out at a time, until I got down to the bare door mechanism.  Everything is switched out and working great, thanks guys!"

"Power window not working. Hypotheses wanted.
My dad was in a minor accident last week.  In short, the rear-view mirror of his F-150 struck the rear-view mirror of a passing pickup truck... and it caused his driver's side window to break.
He is now trying to replace the window, but the power steering button won't work, making it impossible to fit the new window in.  (Neither power window is working, actually.  I think the power windows worked just fine prior to the accident).
Does anyone happen to know what might cause this?  Could the impact of the accident have broken the power windows?  (The window didn't shatter on impact, but it broke... and later shattered when the car door was slammed).  Could this be a motor problem?  A fuse problem?  Other?  And is there any way to test for these things?
I know you have no way of knowing what's wrong, but I'd love to hear your best hypothesis.
Also, can this repair be made *without* a functioning power window?  Can the bottom piece that holds the window be *manually* moved up-and-down somehow?  (It needs to move up and down in order to get the window in).

"I need your help
Today I made an awful decision while driving down the highway. I want to preface this by saying that I know this was very stupid and I know I am an idiot for this so you don't need to tell me, I know. I drive a 2011 Ford f-150 supercrew 4x4 5.0 L with 150,000 miles by the way. Anyways, I was sitting in my truck today before class while it was in ""park"" and my foot accidentally nudged the nob that shifts the vehicle from 2 wheel drive into 4H. I know you are supposed to be in neutral to shift to 4x4 and I obviously was not. I received a message on the dash that said ""check 4x4"" with the orange crescent wrench warning symbol. I immediately put the truck in neutral and turned to nob but to 2 wheel drive and everything seemed to return to normal. I proceeded with my day, and on my way home while driving on the highway I thought it might be a good idea to switch into 4H to see if I still got the crescent wrench warning light (I know in hindsight this was quite the opposite of a good idea). I should mention however, I was not going very fast, which is why I thought I could shift into 4H. I was in stop-and-go traffic and was probably going 25-30 mph when I put the truck in neutral and turned the nob to 4H to see if I got the same warning light. I immediately heard the death grind everyone describes when their car breaks down. It was a long, drawn out clanking, and crashing sound that sounded as if my driveshaft was on the ground. I kind of blacked out as I was frozen in fear so I don't remember exactly what lights came up on the dash, but I think I tried to switch back to 2WD; like I said I don't really remember. The truck would not go over 2000RPM's and I was going no faster than 10 mph, I don't know what was going on at this point but I know that something in my transmission etc. was way off. I drove for another 1/4 to a 1/2 mile as I wanted to get off the highway because there was no shoulder for me to pull over on. I took my first exit and pulled off in some dirt on a construction side, put the truck in park, turned it off and jumped out to see if there was any visible damage underneath. I didn't see anything abnormal, (I have a very basic knowledge of auto maintenance but I know what things are generally supposed to look like). I got back in the truck, put it in 2WD and gave it some gas and everything seemed and felt normal again, no warning lights on my dash, no nothing. So I drove the remaining mile home and here I am now. I don't know what kind of damage I might have done so that is why I am writing to y'all. Should I refrain from driving until I take it to a shop? Do I even need to take it to the shop if there are no warning lights? Any light any of you can shed on the situation would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!"
"Brakes!
So, my 04 Dodge Durango lost brake pressure while driving to a Christmas eve party. Brake peddle went to the floor while going down a mountain. I pumped them a bit and got pressure back. (I'm pretty much a noob but I do a lot of my own work as far as plug and play and bolt on/off stuff goes.) I'm pretty sure this situation means that something along the rear brake section gave out and I'm now running solely on my front breaks. Here is the problem. It was wet out so I could smell brake fluid but couldn't really tell where the leak was. I parked the truck in my garage and let it sit and dry out hoping to find the leaky line some where in the morning. No luck. Is there anything else I should be looking into? Fluid level is down to minimum level. 
???
Update: Got the truck up on a lift at a buddy's house and found zero leaks. Pulled apart the rear calipers and had no pads left on either side. Replaced them and refilled the fluid and it is working perfectly. Maybe they got hot and boiled? Idk. Going back up this weekend to replace the rotors and bleed out all the old fluid and replace with fresh.
Thanks for the help. Although I'm still perplexed by how it just lost all break pressure and half the fluid and there is no trace of fluid anywhere."

"Can I fix a fuel pump myself?
Yesterday my 2001 Chevy S-10 Crew Cab broke down. I was driving and lost power, engine started stumbling and died. I can start the truck but it dies within 10 seconds. Got it towed to my mechanic and he tells me it needs a new fuel pump, new filter, and fuel harness? Says it will cost around $1000. He seems to be a good guy and has helped me out in the past, but I am in college and don't have an extra grand lying around.
My question is can I do this myself? 
I don't have any mechanic experience but I would consider myself fairly handy. I would be willing to purchase tools and I have all of winter break to work on it. Would it be worth attempting it myself? Are there any resources you know of that would help me do this? Websites with a how to guide or a manual I could buy?

"Bedding in brake pads
Hi,
So I'm planning on doing brakes for the first time on my car, a 2006 accord sedan, and I'll be using powerstop z23 pads and centric rotors.  The rotors I think I'm fine with as they seem to just bolt on but I have a question about the pads.  They came with a sheet detailing the bedding in procedures but will I be ok driving on them for a bit until I can get to an area where I can safely accelerate to the necessary speed and slow down repeatedly?  I live in the suburbs and going 50mph down the street and slamming on the brakes multiple times is not an option.
There's a two lane road about 4 miles from my house that is empty late at night that I could use but will driving on the new parts before bedding them in be detrimental?

"1994 F150 5.0 L
Don’t know too much about this truck, but I’m trying to get it in good drivable condition. First, my brakes seem to be having a hard time. While driving, when I depress the brakes, the pedal seems to stop high and the truck is real slow to slow down. I just put new pads, and that didn’t do much. Fluid looks clean, but I’m thinking of bleeding the lines anyway. Also, when I put it in reverse, while I’m holding on the breaks, the truck starts to run rough like it’s about to die and my voltage gauge tanks. Any ideas? "
"Cross-country trip with classic muscle?
This is all conjecture so please bear with me. I've been thinking of going on a roadtrip during the summer here in Canada and probably around the states as well for a month or two. If I somehow magically got my hands on a beat up 65 Mustang or any classic car that ran well, would it be possible to drive around the country in it or would it just die on me?
As a side question, what is it with cars and mileage? Why does a car lose value or why does it break down after running for so many miles? All noob questions, but I don't have anyone else to ask.

"2001 Volvo S60 electrical quirks
Friends,
I have a 2001 Volvo S60 that's acting a bit odd. The other day I took a short drive and instantly felt that something was off - when I put it in reverse it struggled to move where I can usually back out of a spot without any pedal input at all. When I got out and put it in drive, it would barely break 4 MPH, and would almost stop completely while turning. Normally I can pull a steady 10 MPH in drive with no pedal input. Engine was sitting at 850 RPM as it normally does.
This has happened in the past when I've had bad alternators, and I'm on my third alternator in two years, so I'm about done replacing those if the problem is elsewhere. I went through the steps, put my multimeter on the battery while the car was running, and I got a solid 14.00V with the engine at 850 RPM. I turned off the car and waited for the surface charge to dissipate, and I was reading 12.23V, so I took the battery out and tested it outside of the car where I got 12.5V. I took it by Advance and had it tested, it tested just fine (970 CCA rated, 860 CCA actual). When I put it back in the car earlier today it was reading 12.52V before installation, and 12.32V after. I turned on the car and got 14.30V while the engine was sitting around 1100 RPM
I started pulling the easily accessible fuses on the driver's side to see if anything would change the voltage reading on the battery, and found that the only thing that did was removing and reseating the cabin light fuse. When the cabin lights are on it drops down to ~12.20V, and it trickles back up to 12.32-12.34V after I turn them off. Is that a normal voltage drop for just the cabin lights? When I put the ignition in accessory mode and put the high beams on, it drops down to ~11.90V.
This is a Volvo with all the Volvo electrical bullshit that comes with it, and the battery is in the trunk. I hope you guys can help make sense of the readings I got before I start tearing into something that I'll probably end up breaking.
Thanks!"

"Opinions needed: Wrecked 1999 Toyota 4Runner - Worth fixing?
Hey /r/MechanicAdvice/,
This may be a stupid question. I think I probably already know the answer, but maybe some beneficial advice will come out of this, so I am going to give it a shot.
My wife was in an accident Saturday where she banged up the 4Runned pretty bad. Here are [a few pictures](http://imgur.com/KDliJXV) (sorry, only 1 pic, having problems getting the others off my phone - a couple more to come soon) I took before we had it towed. I am not sure the extent of the damage, but the wheel obviously needs replaced and there is some pretty good bumper / quarter panel damage. There is also a little damage in the rear. The engine was still running when I got to her, so I am semi confident that it didn't suffer and major damage, but I may be wrong.
The truck is a 99 4Runner pushing 200k miles. [KBB has it listed between $1900 and $1400](http://www.kbb.com/toyota/4runner/1999-toyota-4runner/sport-utility-4d/?condition=fair&vehicleid=6070&intent=buy-used&mileage=197000&options=231626%7ctrue%7c231751%7ctrue&pricetype=private-party). This is part of the reason I only had liability on it, so none of this will be covered by insurance. Previous to the wreck she was in decent, but not great, condition and she was still running like a champ. She doesn't leak any fluids. I have done nothing major to the engine or drive train in many years though, so I have no additional funds put into her at the moment, and who knows, she could break down at any time, although she was not showing any signs of this.
I have a couple of options here. Option 1: I could sink some money into trying to repair this vehicle (I was hoping to have it last another year or two as I am working my way out of debt). Option 2: I figure out how to get rid of it (hopefully without enduring additional costs) and dig into my savings to purchase a new (used) vehicle.
My questions are as follows:
* Seeing the pictures above, what internal parts do you believe may have been affected by the accident? What should I look at when I go look at her tomorrow?
* Am I an idiot for even thinking about fixing her? 
* And maybe the stupidest question of all (as you have not really seen the extent of the damage), but do you have any rough ideas of how much I might be spending if I do fix her? $500, $2,000, $1,000,000?
* If I don't fix her, is there any advice you have about getting rid of her without enduring additional costs and maybe even make a few bucks to pay for the tow?
edit: I am comfortable/competent enough to do 70% of the work. I would probably need to pay for any body work needed."
"2006 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo Clicking while slowing
Hello,
I've got an '06 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 with the 3.7l V6, automatic trans. 
When I am slowing down to come to a complete stop it you can hear a click and feel the car slow a bit faster and when I let off the break it clicks again and the, I guess it feels like pressure, leaves again and its back to normal. I was wondering if anyone knew what this was already. I have an appointment scheduled to get it looked at, but I was hoping to have an idea of what was wrong before hand. 
Thank you in advance.

"Having issues with my 2003 ford ranger thought I would ask here
Ok so I wanted to see if we had any Experts who might be able to narrow down a issue I am having. As the title says I have a 2003 Ford Edge ranger and the plastic/rubber covers for the crusie control buttons have be breaking up leaving one of the circuits in the cruise control to be exposed.
Well I left my teenage nephew in the truck and he starts jacking with it and ends up pulling the circuit off/out of the cruise control grip. So next thing I know my horn no longer works along with my back lights(Though My break lights work still) Along with my the light that is behind the Speedomoter no longer lights up.
So I would think the simple fix would be buy a new cruise control part but I asked one of the repair guys at the dealership and he told me no way could that have done all this. I know it did because I had zero issues before this happened. Input please?

"Engine miss firing on 1997 Ford Aerostar, 4.0 litre engine, 100,000 km's
Hello Everyone,
My 1997 ford Aerostar has an engine that has been miss firing for a while.  I've done a lot of work to it in hopes of resolving the issue (listed below) but i can't seem to figure it out.  
The missing first occurred when the engine was warmed up, now it occurs all the time, so it has gotten worse over time.  When doing a break stand the missing goes away and stays away for 3 seconds then it starts missing again.  When driving on the highway the problem is hardly noticeable, it chugs when driving in town and when it idles the problem is very noticeable. 
Here is what I have tested:
1. Flushed engine anti freeze twice.
2. (2) different head gasket sealants - made no difference.
3. New fuel injectors.
4. Fuel pump.
5. Fuel filter.
6. Spark Plugs.
7. Spark plug wires.
8. Coil assembly. 
9. Massive airflow sensor.
10. Adjusted Throttle posting sensor (slotted holes to do this).
11. All 3 computers were replaced (under seat, fender, firewall).
12. Leak down test on cylinder #1, computer said error seemed to be related to cylinder #1.  
I noticed after adjusting the TPS  it increased the RPM's which helped relieve some of the issue but it makes it very irritating to drive because when stopped the engine is reved up (like a break stand). 
Any ideas on what the issue might be or what else I can check?  I love this van because its in minty shape, hauls and doesn't burn oil at all.  Its great and I would like to keep it going.  
Edit: It does not burn coolant, and does not knock, does not even burn oil.  3500 miles to litre of oil if that. Engine is newer (only 100,000 kms). "

Here's what he has to say about his truck.
""1994 Chevy Silverado K1500 4x4. This was my project for while, but don't have the time anymore.
-It has a rebuilt transmission with about 1500 miles on it. 
-All new front end parts. (ball joints, tie rods, steering components) as well as U-joints.
- Tires are still 80% to 90%. 
-Interior is exceptionally clean for the year, body isn't too bad. 
-Manual 4x4 works and engages and shifts fine.
- Headers and 3 inch exhaust with Flowmaster. 
-Heads have a fresh rebuild from Chuck's Engine.
-Started to do a restore and started undercoating the frame and cab.
The only bad thing is I swapped in another motor (350 sbc) and threw on the rebuilt heads and during break in it making a strange noise- squeaking/pinging/knocking. I really don't have the time to look into it or work on it anymore.""

"2004 mazda 6 2.3L i4 clutch issue
I just had my clutch acting up on my car. .it has 227k kms I bought it used 4yrs ago and it had 160k kms on it. Now im not sure if the previous owner changed the clutch. 
The original issue I had was with the car having a hard time shifting into gears,  it would be a struggle and be very hard physically to put Into gear, took it to the shop the clutch pedal was cracked and my master cylinder was leaking. The shop weldes my pedal back and changed my master cylinder and that fixed the whole problem for 10 months. 
Now im at the exact same place I originally was at so I took the car to mazda to get a brand new clutch assembly put in, did not solv my problem. I took it to my other mechanic and they tell me they think its the clutch and it may need to be changed and I explained that I had the exact same issue as before and they fixed it and it felt brand new without having to change the clutch and now im having the exact same issue.
They load it up on the lift and inspect it, they see that my slave cylinder is rusty and looks like shit and is barely moving when my clutch pedal is being pressed. so they told me the other shop should have changed it rhe same time they did the master. They get a new slave and install it and they are good cool ppl so im helping the guy cuz hes alone..I hop in the car snd were having a hard time bleeding the system and we keep pumping and draining trying to get as much air out as possible and the pedal isn't returning on its own so we keep on trying to build up some pressure and there I am pumping away at the pedal and still not returning and low pressure. ..although he said it looks good from down there the pedal was being an issue.. now I go and pump it a few more times and next thng I hear is snap and my pedal drops to the floor and low and behold the fork looking part that helps separate or push out the clutch plates snaps and he pulls it out and tells me how lucky I am it happend at the shop with the engine off..how it coulda gone flying into the clutch and ruin my whole transmission.  im thinking holy fuck are you serious? 
So now my car is stuck at the shop and they have to pull the transmission down and take a look at it. He said he will check the condition of the clutch and if I may need to replace it or not but if I dont the fork peice is about $100 and labour cost. 
Now my question why did the fork part break?  normal wear and tear?  or is it because its never been changed before along with the clutch ? I dont think I need a new clutch as I've never had any clutch slippage issues or any burnt clutch smell, ive done a few of the clutch tests online and it passes them all as in my clutch is fine stil.... im really wondering if I should get a new clutch installed since he will have the tranny down?
TLDR; car 5spd very hard to shift into gear. pedal is cracked and master cylinder changed. .feels brand new and good..10 months later same issue..mechanic says slave cylinder is shot and he changes it...trying to bleed the system the fork looking peice that separates the clutch plates cracks..
do I need a whole new clutch kit installed or just a new fork. .the clutch doesnt slip at all for me and passes clutch tests that I tried. mechanic hasn't gotten back to me on the clutch condition
thank you!"
"I made a boo boo on my trooper...
So I had four pallets on my roof rack, masterfully tied down I might add, and I sort of forgot about them when I got to my destination. So I'm cruising into the car shelter and I hear some horrible noises and slam on the breaks. Shit. Thankfully, they shifted back some when they hit the shelter and there was no harm done to said shelter.  However, one of the corners' screws were pulled out of the roof and that corner of the rack is broken off. Also the rear end of the roof was sort of bent in under the corners of the rack but I popped that out decently enough on site.

"2001 Mustang 3.8 Coolant Leak
*UPDATE* I found the leak. Can't believe my friend and I both missed it. It was the coolant bypass hose. [Here it is.](http://i.imgur.com/jwMVOLd.jpg) I'm going to leave this post up because it may benefit someone in the future and it took a while to type out.
*UPDATE 2* Got the hose replaced, coolant filled and all seems well! Cleaned out the engine bay to get rid of most the coolant residue as well. Going to need a few more washes but should be good as new! What seemed like it was going to be a total disaster worked out pretty well!
I was on my way to Caffeine and Octane in Atlanta this morning and on the on-ramp to the highway I felt a bit of a ""jump"" in the car while accelerating spiritedly. It should be added that the motor was warm but probably not fully to temp. As if suddenly some strain/drag had been removed from the motor. I looked in my review and the was white smoke EVERYWHERE. I'm thinking, ""great, just blew a head gasket.""
I managed to pull off at the next exit and into a parking lot within one mile. The temp gauge stayed normal so I don't think I cooked it. Upon inspection in the parking lot with my friends we discovered there was coolant literally everywhere in the engine bay. The good news is no smoke from the tail pipes and the engine felt pretty normal. So not catastrophic.
My friend is a mechanic and I'm pretty handy myself. We had a look around and it felt like the upper radiator hose had a cut/small horizontal break in it so we figured that must be it. It was on the bottom and back of the hose so we couldn't be positive.
We decided to leave the car and let it cool off and deal with it later. Got to ride in a sweet 550hp Shelby so things weren't all bad.
On the way back we stopped at an Advanced and got a new upper hose and some 50/50. Mechanic friend also got himself a hose clamp tool since he wanted one anyway.
We get back to my car, replace the hose and fill up the radiator and reservoir. I limp the car back home keeping the revs as low as possible (no more than 2,500 rpm) but I did have to take the highway back, it was by far the shortest and safest route. Things seem to be going well but the car warmed up a little faster than normal but it's ~75F outside. As I get back to my apartment complex there's white smoke coming out from the hood again. I parked and sure enough coolant is bloody everywhere again and there's a trail of water/coolant where my car has been.
I'm currently letting it cool down but as coolant is everywhere I'm just not really sure where to start. I'm thinking about rinsing the motor and going from there. My mechanic friend also told me he could borrow a pressure tester tomorrow to help find the leak. The reason I'm posting this is I'd at least like to get the problem narrowed down. It's the first actual problem I've had with the car in the near 10 years I've owned it and in 157,000 miles.
I have not modified the cooling system in any way, the car only has some pretty standard bolt-ons, drivetrain upgrades and a tune. Intake manifold is stock and steel, not plastic. Main hoses and coolant have been replaced/changed at their specified intervals.
Based on the coolant covering the entire engine bay, my best guess is something towards the top and front of the engine. I know this motor pretty well from working on it but I'm still stumped.
Are there any ""common"" coolant leaks or somewhere else I should start?"
"Couple questions regarding 07 Trailblazer
Ok, so firstly, I don't know if this matters or not, it has been hot as hell here. Topped 100 today and it has for a few days. Any who, I just got off work earlier, had to stop by my moms about 20 miles away. So I'm driving on the interstate, cranking the A/C, at some point I notice the check engine light on. 
Once I'm back into town, I stop by the O'Reillys auto parts and ask them to run a diagnostic. It comes back with two issues.
1. Trouble Code p0506 , Idle Speed Low, can list possible causes and reported fixes if necessary. 
2. Trouble Code p0106 , MAP Sensor Performance. 
Both issues list both Cleaned Throttle Body, and Cleaned Intake Manifold as reported fixes.
So I go to drive home, pull into the garage, and go to pop the hood to have a look, and...... The hood won't pop. WTF? 
I'm not entirely sure what I'm looking for, but when I push the latch release thing, I can see that it moves out of the way, so that it LOOKS like it SHOULD open right up. I held the latch release up, and tried giving a few good tugs up on the hood but it didn't budge, I mean I was lifting it hard enough to be bouncing the front of the truck up and down, I didn't want to break anything, so, here I am. 
Anyone care to take a crack at these issues that all just hit me at once today? 
EDIT; Figured out the hood problem. Or rather, pulled that bitch up til it popped open. It seems to relatch, hold, release, and open, without any trouble now. So that was weird, but I'm glad it opens now.
So, any advice on the trouble codes its shooting? "
"Should I worry this noise/vibration is my breaks or something else?
I have a 2007 Toyota Camry, and just over the last week, almost 90% of the time my breaks makes this kind of deep noise, like the brake pads are trying to resist something. I know that's not a great explanation of the sound. It also vibrates really badly depending on the speed. At 60 MPH and above, if I start to brake hard, it vibrates the steering wheel and I can feel it in my seat, but not the pedal. Between 40-60 MPH I can still feel it, but not as bad, and under 40 I can hardly feel it, if at all. This also happens when I break with at least the pedal halfway down, no matter what speed, so if I press down a little it won't vibrate or make a sound. I *think* it might be coming from the front left wheel, but I can't be too sure. Any input would be great. "
"How can you tell if your tires need to be realigned? Information inside.
I got my breaks replaced a few months back, and since I felt that things just weren't quite right. Sometimes when I am driving at around 45-50 mph there would be a light vibration coming from the front tires that felt and sounded like going over a rumble strip, but much much much lighter than an actual rumble strip. 
This would happen sporadically... sometimes it would start and sometimes it wouldn't (I couldn't ever make it do it on purpose). It would last for maybe a minute or two and would just go away on its own. Slowing down or speeding up wouldn't cause it to stop, it would just decide to stop eventually.
I have also noticed more and more a sound that seems to be dependent on the speed of my tires. This sound is pretty constant, and a really light ""th th th th th th th th"" noise that speeds up when I speed up and slows down when I slow down.
My tire pressure is good, and I just changed the oil (it has always been kept very well with oil changes). It is a 2001 Chevy Malibu, if that matters."

"1996 Miata ('94 Engine) shut off because of overheating - did I cause permanent damage?
Hey guys,
After bringing out my '96 Miata (1994 Engine) from hibernation yesterday, I was driving it and it shut off. I thought maybe I stalled it, but it happened again and I (very luckily) used the momentum to roll into a gas station.
I seem to have identified the problem - fuse for cooling fans was out, engine overheated and coolant all burnt off. Coolant has been refilled, fans tested and work now, and all fluids checked (oil was not milky). The engine is running strong and idling normally (<1K).
My concern is, if the engine got hot enough to shut off entirely - what caused it? I've seen some guesses on miata.net - but I want to feel confident that the car will not break down on me while driving it. Is it at all possible that no permanent damage was done to the engine, or am I in trouble - and if I am, how do I check to ensure my engine is running well again?
Thank you in advance, just want to have some confidence back in my little friend.

"Asking for advice on which (brand/type of) car to buy in America. (I have some experience in other countries, detailed below, but I know that it doesn't transfer. cheap and easy repairs in one country are expensive in another.)
So.. in Israel, my preferences (after some bad experiences) was to always go with the oriental. we had an old suzuki swift as a second car and it was perfect, never broke down, never needed service, and when we took it for the periodic service it was cheap. 
based on that , we made a big mistake in England, and got a Hyundai Trajet. not very new , 7 seater. when something breaks , which it does, the parts are not readily available, and are expensive.
(i didn't even consider European cars here, because my experience with one in Israel, chiefly - everything made of plastic breaks in a few years due to the harsh sun, (A/C nob was like ~100$ to replace when it got all cracked after 2 years from new))
so my question is, what should I go for as a rule ? would I be getting bang for the buck on japanese cars (Toyota Camry is getting good reviews)? cheaper repairs on a Ford? 
I guess budget is the question. I was thinking about ~7K$ for a used car, but then I saw that for ~10K there's a small Nissan family car, so I could go for that ..
any thoughts or criticisms would be welcome.  (if location makes a difference then it would be NY/NJ , so {snow  /  ice+deicing salt  /  summer sun  } is the climate i guess)
I hope I found the right place, but i could find no better fitting subreddit, would be happy to relocate the discussion 
thanks "
"Just genuinely need some advice about what to do and if I should try and get my vehicle worked on or if it's not worth the cost (2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo)
I'll start this off by admitting I am super ignorant when it comes to cars and I'm WAY out of my element here so please be patient.  And SORRY this is so long (there's a TL:DR at the bottom)
At the end of October I purchased a 2001 Jeep GCL from a work friend. BEFORE I paid for it, I took it to a mechanic and paid to have it checked out. It was already high mileage at like 220k and had a power steering leak and rear axle needed replaced (seller was forthcoming about this). The mechanic told me that the car was a good value and besides the issues that I already knew about, it didn't seem anything was wrong with it, and if the power steering was replaced frequently it would be ok.
A couple weeks later with about 1/8 gas in the tank, it started sputtering really badly when reversing after being in idle for a while. When trying to go forward it seemed like there wasn't power to accelerate. I took it back in and was told there could be a misfire in the engine. With the gas kept up and being mindful about idling (no long idles, then shutting the car down, then immediately restarting it and backing up) the sputtering wasn't an issue. This whole time I'm essentially just trying to save up enough to pay for the problems I knew about to begin with and to put new tires on it, because they were desperately needed. 
A couple of weeks later someone lets me know that the driver side brake light isn't working. Turns out that there's a wiring issue and the brake light stays on, but when you hit the brake it shuts off. 
About 3 weeks ago there was a loud crunch noise while reversing and the car started vibrating horribly and sounding like metal was dragging. Turns out the drive shaft was broken. Mechanic pulled the drive shaft off completely. Noise gone, vibrations gone. Told to make an appt with ""drive shaft guy"" about an hour away who can fix it for $100. This was meant to happen this upcoming week. They also tell me there is frame damage, but denied they could have missed it before when I had them inspect it before I made the decision to buy it. They said that the frame was bent in such a way that the force of it would have made the car stop...well, this never happened, so the other explanation is they missed the frame damage when they were supposed to check it out initially.
3 nights ago I'm heading to a laundromat and the car is in idle while I'm returning a redbox movie. Maybe 5-8 minutes. While backing out the car starts smoking from the hood. White smoke, it doesn't seem like too much at first but after driving a few minutes it is clear that it is BILLOWS of smoke. Car gets stopped, fluids get checked. Antifreeze is added. Make point to check ground to see if it's leaking. No leak. After cooling about 30 mins, car is driven about four minutes further to the home of someone who works at the garage. It is towed to the garage the next morning when the mechanic tries to put antifreeze in it and says it immediately leaks all over the place. I get a call the next day saying that the head gasket is blown, a hose had been split and they replaced it, and the water pump (edit: water pump not tank) needed to be replaced. They said they'd have to replace the water pump before they could work on the head gasket and suggested they try a blue devil product to seal it up. The total for the tow, hose, water tank and to TRY the blue devil (which apparently might not even work) +labor is $725. To completely replace the head gasket will be around $1400 minimum. 
Ultimately I just need advice as to the best course of action. I don't have a lot of money to put towards this (or towards a new vehicle). Probably maybe $1000. I don't think the car is even worth anything in parts. I know I wont get back what I paid for the tires, even though they're not even three weeks old and have probably not even 150 miles on them - It's just used to go back and forth to work.  I'm worried if I somehow find a way to pay $1400 (or more) that the car might still not work properly and I'd be completely out of options. Should I try to get this fixed? If I decide to get rid of it, what are my options? 
TL:DR Car I paid $1200 for in Oct has been doing nothing but break down in different ways even after being checked out by mechanics  before purchase. Latest break is blown head gasket less than 2 weeks after spending $500 on new tires and oil change. Will now cost from $700-$2000 to attempt to repair, but I don't know if it's worth it or what else I can do."
"A question about modern day turbo's
So my dad always told me when you drive a car with a turbo fast you must let it idle for about 10 minutes for it to cool down or it will have an issue. (I don't know what exactly breaks) I was wondering if modern day turbo powered cars have the same issue?

"99 Chrysler 300M will not start
I realize this is a long shot but maybe I will get some info. The electronics work, I can hear the fuel pump turning on or whatever it is doing when it makes that noise. When I try and start it, nothing happens, it isn't even trying to turn over anymore. It was having starting troubles before, I would try and start it, it would turn over but then stop. After a few tries it would start up, or sometimes it would just turn on right away. 
I don't know if this is related but.....when I try putting down the window behind me, it will shut off the radio, my key fob doesn't work, the power locks don't work. I just put a new fuse in but I thought that was weird. So my guess is that it is an electrical issue? Thank you for any help.
I am not that smart when it comes to vehicles, so ELI5

I drive an 06 Pontiac Grand Prix GT, and I know the transmissions I those cars aren't the most reliable, but I've never had much trouble with mine. Today I left work and drove to meet some friends, a few miles down the road I noticed that while accelerating, the car was shaky and jerky, the Rpm's weren't smooth or consistent and it was revving higher than normal and not making nearly as muc power as usual. I was concerned it might break down so I babied it the whole way there. I got to the place I was meeting, stayed for about 30 minutes, and when I turned my car back on all of the problems I had before were gone. Anything I should be concerned about?

My wife and I are in the middle of trying to find and buy a house, and besides using the car as a commuter for my day job, I’m using it to drive for UberEATS to help build our savings for the down payment/closing costs.
I just want this car to run as long as possible until we close on a house. It doesn’t have to run well, I just would prefer that it doesn’t break down and completely die. Is there an easy way to diagnose these codes and perform any quick fixes to keep it going for a month or two? After that, I don’t care — I’ll sell it for scrap, and we’ll get a new car. But what can I do to help keep this puppy running for the short\-term?"
"Engine Oil during break: is using synthetic to seat piston rings a myth?
My car is getting a new small block from Subaru, which also comes with new piston rings. All my life I've been taught that an engine needs a break in period when new, and it should use conventional oil so piton rings can seat properly, or else down the road you may get some power loss and excessive oil usage (why car is in shop in the first place). This has gone with everything from generators, chainsaws, motorcycles etc... Many manufacturers use synthetic right out of the gate though for automobiles, including performance cars like the Corvette. Toyota, Honda, Lexus, Acura are a few I know come out of the factory with synthetic also. So is this just a myth with the modern engine, or still good practice. 
2012 Subaru Impreza 5spd Wagon naturally aspirated. It has 50k miles on it now, and will when I get it back with block and rings. If they put synthetic right away, should I switch to conventional or leave synthetic in and let the engine do its thing. All of my small engine stuff normally gets just mineral based oil anyway so I'm not as concerned there."
"MR2 Spyder 2003 possible issues
Today I picked up a MR2 Spyder 2003 with my friend. He needed to a ride to pick up the car, plus I was going to teach him stick. He picked up on it really fast, and long story short, we drove around and landed in an empty parking lot. He let me take the wheel and I decided to have some fun.  
But I noticed something odd. The clutch was hard to push. I drive a 2007 Saturn Sky. I keep my car in perfect condition, plus it's only at 23k miles, so I don't know if I'm just spoiled with my easy clutch, but his clutch was hard to push.  
When I released the clutch, it was slow to rise and I couldn't really accelerate the way I wanted too because the clutch simply wouldn't release fast enough. At higher speeds, I could change gears nearly as quick as I wanted too and I have a short shifter on my car and I shift fast. This car kept up with me, so the clutch seemed to only be a problem when starting from 0 as it was hard to accelerate at faster speeds.  
Then, when I tried to show him some stupid moves, I was holding down the breaks while clutching and revved for maybe 3 seconds (I was explaining to him what I was doing and the RPM was only around 5k, so not low, but nothing crazy) and I smelled what you'd smell if you were driving around with your E clutch up, so I stopped revving immediately and didn't proceed with my shenanigans.   
My car can rev in red for a decent time and I've never had that happen to me (not that I do that long or often), but the reason I give you this story is I don't know what it means. He was curious too, but I want to make sure we fix up this car if there are things wrong.   
is the MR2 supposed to have that sticky feeling clutch and why did I smell the break fluid when reving the engine for a very short time?"
"2002 Jeep Grand Cherokee 4.7L V8 Sputters and stalls at first stop sign/light in the morning. Struggles to start again, and then runs fine the rest of the day.
Hi All,
Thanks for taking a look at my post. I'm at wit's end with this intermittent problem I'm having with my 2002 Jeep Grand Cherokee 4.7L V8 Limited.
A couple of winters ago it started stalling in the morning the first time I would stop, either at a stop light or stop sign. It feels like the car is ""wheezing"" right before it happens, and RPMs jump around between 0 and 500, struggling to stay above 500 and then voltage drops a little but stays between 12v-14v . I figured out that if I let up off the break when it starts happening, I can keep it from stalling out just long enough for the light to turn green. The times I can't keep it on and it stalls out, I can get it started with some effort. If I pump on the gas a few times then it comes back on strong, and then doesn't even think about stalling again for the rest of the day. But then the next morning it happens all over again. Weirdly this only really presents itself consistently in winter. From spring to fall it happens maybe 2-3 times.
I've taken it in 3 times already to 2 different mechanics and neither could reproduce it. It's never had any issues and never broken down on me in the 14 years I've had it. I brought all service and maintenance up-to-date when it hit 100k miles 2 summers ago (after the issue started) so I really want to figure out what's causing this. 
On the recommendation of some folks over at Jeep Forums I ran through some more troubleshooting, and removed and thoroughly cleaned the throttle body, and idle air control valve, and replaced my battery. I also had the computer checked for codes, nothing came up. Alternator also passed tests at AutoZone and with my FLUKE. 
If anybody has any ideas on things to check I would greatly appreciate it. I'm  familiar with car components from working with my dad on his classic cars and I have a mechanics tool set, so I'm willing to test/try anything.
I've already started considering buying a new car, but I was hoping to get the Jeep to last at least until I graduate and get accepted to grad school next spring.
Thanks for taking the time to read this!"
"94 ford escort spat out coolant after turning car off
So I'm hoping this was just a result of me over filling my coolant, but I thought you guys might know what the hell happened. 
I've got a 94 ford escort with a head gasket leak. It's external, and when my mechanic discovered it a few weeks ago it was still small. He estimated that with some careful maintenance of my radiator I could get it to last another year or so before the car dies. So because of this I've been checking my coolant twice a week and keeping it full. 
Yesterday I had my first ""long"" trip since I found out about my head gasket. I've only been taking it on 10 minute trips to and from work, but this one was 30-40 minutes. Soon as I parked the car it started spitting out a stream of coolant just in front of the passenger tire. I checked my overflow tank and it was full to the brim. After about 5-10 minutes it stopped spitting out coolant, and my overflow started to drain (I assume into the radiator). Once it cooled down enough I checked my radiator and it's levels were fine. 
 I took a quick look around with a flashlight, and I didn't see any leaks. After a whole I drove it home. It didn't seem to leak, and my temp gauge stayed low the whole way. It didn't spit out any more coolant when I parked it at home. 
So the question is, did I fuck up by over filling my car with coolant, or did something else break on my little junker? "
"'03 Mazda Protege, engine knock coming back after being fixed
EDIT: Following advice from /u/sgtspike I filled up with 89 octane gas instead of 87. I also put in a bottle of Red Line fuel system cleaner. I'm almost through my second tank and so far the knocking issue hasn't come back at all. My mileage has also improved a bit.
I have an '03 Mazda Protege LX (manual) with almost 98k miles on it. Mostly city driving with a few longer trips (~100-300 miles) a couple times a year. I know very little about auto repair but I'll do my best to provide relevant info.
Short version: engine pinging sound when under load and especially going up hills, seems loudest in lower RPMs of lower gears. Not audible within the car, only audible with windows down when I drive past hard surfaces or other cars/objects that reflect the noise. I'm sure it's very audible for someone outside. It's an inconsistent clinking noise, almost like a few pebbles tumbling in a can or something. 
I had the same issue before, but worse, a couple thousand miles ago ago. The sound was louder and happened more consistently. Also the car would lurch sometimes when accelerating or dip very low in RPMs during idle (never stalled but very close). This became worse over time, the pinging was the first symptom and I didn't even know if they were related. The check engine light came on only once, then off again later that same day. This probably lasted a month or two before I took it into a local shop (the day after the engine light came on). They told me the air intake hose was sheared nearly in half, they weren't sure why, but it messed up the gas/air combination. So they replaced it. After that the car ran much smoother and no pinging.
A bit later I got new rear struts, at the same shop as before. At that time the guy also told me my radiator had a bad leak and needed to be replaced, entirely to the tune of $600 or so. Now, I've never noticed a leak or puddle under my car at all, nor has my engine even slightly overheated (to my knowledge) even on highway road trips of several hundred miles.
EDIT: forgot to mention, I declined the radiator service cause I wanted to research before dropping that money. From what i learned, I have zero symptoms of a badly leaking radiator, so I never took it back or contacted them again.
I should also say that after the above service I noticed a consistent dip in my MPG, down to 20-22 from maybe 22-24 city. I still get upper 20s highway. I calculate my MPG on every fill-up so I'm pretty sure of this.
Couple months later, came to the same shop for new tires and alignment, and also asked them for a general inspection. They told me I had a water pump leak and needed to replace that. I didn't say anything about the radiator issue from before and neither did they. I told them I couldn't afford it right now. This was the point where I became extremely suspicious.
Fast forward to a few weeks ago, the pinging is happening again. Not as bad as before, and no weird engine revving or RPM dipping, just the sound when going up hills (and not all the time, just sometimes). I took the car to Jiffy Lube for an oil change, asked them to check the air intake hose to see if anything wrong with it. They said nope, but, they noticed a slight oil leak and (this is so strange) when they took out my oil filter to replace it, there was no oil on it. They said it was dry. He seemed uncertain but he thought it must be a problem with the oil pump and he recommended I ask a shop to look at it.
I'm basically WTFing at all of this. I can't tell if the shop I usually go to is incompetent or just trying to shake me down for unnecessary work. I'm also uncertain whether it was actually the air intake that was the problem, wondering if maybe they fixed something else temporarily that they knew would break again (since the same issue is coming back). They're local and very well-reviewed, maybe that doesn't count for as much as I thought?
This car has treated me very well for the last 40,000 miles since I bought it. I'm not opposed to spending money to keep it maintained and I worry that engine pinging can be a sign of something really bad. But I can't understand why I'm always being told different things about what's wrong with it.
Sorry for wall of text. I'd love to get some advice."
"05 dodge neon srt4 - difficult shifting
So after just recently installing new master/slave cylinders the having a hell of a time trying to get all of the air out of the system then immediately having my timing belt break then fixing that I am having trouble shifting again. A few days ago I had noticed it became difficult to shift I checked the fluid in the reservoir it seemed a little low so I added some fluid the problem seemed to go away. Today suddenly the difficulty shifting has returned it feels like the clutch isn't disengaging similar to how it was before the master/slave was replaced. I even rolled forward with my car in first foot on the clutch and off the brake. When I finally got home I checked the fluid level and it's still full. Inot order to shift I had to push/pull very hard to get to the next gear with my foot practically in the engine bay. 
About a year or so ago I had the clutch replaced at a shop and ever since then there has been a rediculous amount of clutch chatter woth this clutch. I know that clutch chatter is normal with aftermarket clutches but this chatter is so loud that it makes me embarrassed to sit at a light next to someone with their window down so yes I have been sitting with the clutch in a lot because of the insanely loud noise that comes from my clutch. Anyway I had been attributing the excessive clutch chatter to the mopar TOB that was used with the Clutchmasters clutch that was installed. I don't know how much difference there is in TOBs but the one that came with the clutch somehow got lost in the sauce. The shop also refused to use the ARP flex plate bolts that I bought along with the clutch because they said they weren't the right bolts because the sticker said ""hemi"" everything was purchased from Modern Performance (a parts store that specializes in these cars), the Clutchmasters stage 3, the ARP flexplate bolts, the AGP pivot fork and the mopar pivot ball. One of my best guesses is the shop some how screwed up the install, this is why I usually do all of my work myself. Long story short I didn't have time, took it to a shop, clutch installed, shifted okay, made a crazy amount of noise,tons of issues since.
Also today when I turned off my engine there was an extra bit of rattle in the vicinity of the clutch in the bell housing like something was coming to a rest. I don't know if something might of come loose, broken, or the extra noise is in my imagination. 
Where do I go from here to diagnose and fix this thing?"
"Corolla didnt start, but now it does and produces thick smoke and weird RPM! please help
hey, so quick info dump: car is corolla, 2012
about a 4 days ago, i went to autoshop and had my oil changed. The shop also replaced a filter or something (not sure? cost 80 to put and 40 to remove) and transfered my front and back wheels.
not sure if the problem is related but just wanted to say it. anyway after driving to work for 2 days or so, today, i went to start the car in the morning but it couldnt. I pushed the keys and but the engine just did the starting sound without actually starting. At first I thought it was because it was cold (windshield iced and all, although never had this happen before?) so i left it for the sun and tried it again but it didnt start. So I kept pushing the keys (at this time the wheels were locked and so were the breaks). and weirdly, at finally, i just ramed the keys all the way for few seconds and it started, seems like the car kept making the noise so I wasnt able to hear it but looks like it started few second before i let go of the key.
now the weird part, The car RPM kept going up from 800 to almost 1500 slowly while the gear was in parked. I noticed that the smoke was very dense as well, it was more than usual, and i even compared it with my rev 4 and rev 4 made almost no smoke while parked and start but the RPM was also higher than expected at 1200 but it started going down until it was 1000. I then turned off the Corolla and turn it back on and it was on pretty normally but the RPM was still very high compared to what I'd normally see, it was hovering in the 900-1200 even tho all these years it had always been 800. the smoke is still very thick and i can smell a strong odor (the first time but it gradually went away) inside the corolla.
so do i worry about this? this is my first ""winter"", just moved from a hot state to a new northern one so maybe thats why? The smoke is really worrying me. The car still moved, i parked it close to the rev 4 so I could do battery revive if needed.
any info or suggestion is helpfull!"

"1995 Dodge Dakota Front Shocks
So I was here yesterday, about the upper ball joints (they went in perfectly woohoo!), and now i'm here about front shocks. 
The front shocks are like [These](http://imgur.com/TgJEPAd) where on the top of them you're supposed to hold onto it with a little tiny 1/4 in socket so the pole doesn't spin as you unscrew the nut holding it down. Well...that 1/4 inch socket just rounded off the little thing. So I've come with three thoughts of how to fix this, thought one is to used a [nut buster too](http://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/d/l225/m/mgJ7T-1v80AUf9DmGS4ruLQ.jpg) and try to break it loose with that, thought number two is to use a dremel on that same nut and cut it off, or thought number three would be to use a hacksaw, fit between the spring (the shock goes up in the spring) and cut the pole and then just pull that pull up and out, [it wouldn't be my first time using a hacksaw for front steering/suspension parts.](http://imgur.com/a/9CKIm) The main pain is that the upper nut is kind of sunken into the upper control arm, so it's hard to get a wrench on that nut, need some sort of [off set wrench](http://www.harborfreight.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/i/m/image_17649.jpg) but what i saw at my local auto parts store the off set wouldn't be enough as it's in there pretty deep, plus i still have the problem of that pole spinning, i could use vice grips i assume, but i don't want to bung up the threads as i have to get that nut off, then i thought of using a piece of rubber in the vice grips to protect the threads, but idk i kinda like using hack saws :P

I normally would just discount it as shit happens but the UJoints in the truck have been replaced several time (most recently in december 2013) and it happened once before.  About 4 years ago I was on the highway and the drive shaft broken similarly but the whole rear-end had to be replaced.  I had significant warning (shaking, banging, etc.)  and was just ignored by my mom (vehicle owner).  It was replaced with the rear out of a 1996 dakota.  For the most part everything has been fine UJoints have been replaced twice since then.  Most recently the yolk and transfer case seals were replaced and fluid flushed (transmission, diffs, radiator).  My question is essentially, could there be something more wrong with the vehicle causing my drive shaft to break off, Is it likely the incidents are related? or do I just have terrible luck?"
"1996 Chevy Suburban Power Steering pump
Hey, 
I have my 1996 suburban torn down trying to get the power steering pump out to swap/rebuild and I'm frustrated and trying to figure out where I am hung up. 
I got the pulley off, I got the front three bolts off it and I think I got the only two nuts on the back of it holding the bracket. I undid the P/S bracket bolts and it's currently only being held on with the nut that goes to the stud screwed into the block. The lines are still on it because I didn't want to try and undo them by feel and mess up a fitting. 
I can rotate the pump assembly clockwise in the P/S bracket, but I can't get the thing to rotate completely out to where I can get the lines or pull it out. I CAN see another bolt head that looks to be holding the bracket on the back to the P/S pump itself, but there's no way in hell I could get a wrench on it. 
Any ideas appreciated. I can take pictures if anyone needs em. Thanks! 
Edit: I did just spray ATF/acetone on the fittings for the lines at the bottom to try and break em if I have to pull them, but I would assume I shouldn't need to just to get the assembly out. "

I ran it with the choke on and it runs much better up until mid rpms and it bogs down again. 
Do I need to adjust the jetting? Richer or leaner? I’ve checked for air leaks and there aren’t any I can see or know of.
Thanks!"
"Worth the Repair Cost? [Update]
Here's the original post on my 2002 Chevy Malibu: https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicAdvice/comments/703nol/worth_the_repair_cost/
I worked on it myself. I replaced the radiator coolant tank cap, which was cracked. That seems to have solved the issue with losing coolant, since the coolant tank is pressurized in my car. I also replaced the battery, which was past its shelf life, and replaced the alternator with one from a junk yard.
The car now starts without a jump and stays running. There's a new rattle when I turn it on and when I push the accelerator, so I'm assuming I left something loose somewhere.
I don't think there's any head gasket issues since my exhaust is clear like usual, my motor oil color/texture seems normal, and my engine temperature seems steady. I think the steam was just from the coolant escaping quickly due to the cap being cracked. 
My biggest concern is that the engine doesn't sound steady, so I'm afraid to drive it anywhere in case I break down. The engine sounds like it's running fine, then it will falter for a few seconds like it's going to shut off, then it runs fine again. Did I get a bad alternator or is something else going on now?"
"2004 Kia Sedona Minivan won't start - mechanic isn't sure and on vacation for 2 weeks - I'm an okay DIYer.
Okay so my van is a POS - officially... and honestly should be set on fire but I'm just trying to get it rolling again, without me pushing it!
Last week I went to run errands and the van wouldn't start. No click-click of the starter, just a quiet humming noise from under the hood as I turned the key. You would assume it's the starter - but it's brand new (6 months old) and I brought it in for service a few weeks ago for a weird noise (the battery cable was getting smacked around by the starter motor on start up). It's also not the battery, which is also only 8 months old, and the next day I went to the local advanced autoparts and had everything tested for voltage and output/etc. Alternator, battery, and starter all have great readouts. Car ran great for a few days.... 
Then I was stranded 100 miles from home at a client's house, in their driveway, at midnight, in the pouring rain.... with my assistant stuck in the van with me (as I was like, come along for the ride and help save the environment with carpooling!). I pushed the van down the driveway, tried to jump start it. 
Jumpstart did absolutely nothing. Same experience with the humming when you turn the key. Electronics and everything worked great, no other symptoms.
Now I get the thing towed to my local garage and my super awesome honest mechanic can't get to it for 3 days. He's always overwhelmed with too many cars in their tiny shop, but I trust him as much as my mechanic dad (now I do it myself as he passed in 2012). 
Mechanic looks at it, the problem isn't apparent immediately and the car starts right up! Now he has it a few days, finally it decides to not start for him and he plays around with a few things. Car continues to start after only being a POS for him once. He believes it's the ignition switch. The shop is now closed for almost 2 weeks and I can't be without a working van (both for work and life). 
I drove it home on his recommendation so that it doesn't get broken into during the shop's closure. He recommended if I get stuck to jiggle the key in the ignition to try to get the thing to start up. That hasn't worked at all. It's stuck in front of my apartment. 
Also now my check engine light and airbag lights are on. The check engine MIGHT be because my 3 catalytic converters all are shit and have holes in them - until I can afford the money to replace them one by one, front to back. 
What I've done: I've checked the fuses for the ignition, start up, checked under the hood for anything loose, wiggly, weird. 
What mechanic has done: ordered an ignition switch, which he'll let me use and try until we determine if it's actually broken, if it is I pay for it, if not, he returns it and we're back to 'what the hell is wrong now?'. He's also cleaned the battery terminals and inspected the battery cables for corrosion/damage/etc. He also replaced the fog light (relay?) bc it was damaged or burnt out. 
Also included is all the work I've had done in the past 12 months since I bought the lemon... just in case it's applicable. 
Battery,
Wiper motors,
Wipers,
Starter,
Speed Sensors (x2),
Tires,
Rear Brake Line,
Neutral Safety Switch,
New Lightbulbs,
New headlight fixtures,
New rear lightbulbs & grommets,
New Motor/Engine,
Front & Rear Brakes & Rotors,
New Timing Belt,
New Spark Plugs,
New AC & Serpentine Belts,
New Water Pump,
There's probably other stuff I can't think of...
What I think is up? I think the battery cable smacking into the starter whacked some of the teeth off the motor/gears and it's got a dead zone. I had to bring the van in when it was making horrible noises and sounded like it was overcranking to a different shop - one I had the starter warrantied with - and they charged me 60$ to move the battery cable. Now the warranty is just passed... and I think it's that. 
I have no idea why the Airbag light is on, or exactly how to shut it off. The fuse is good, swapped and still is on. I've read I can reset it via removing my negative battery terminal? If it comes back on, then what? I definitely can't afford the options at the local Kia dealership. I read there can be shorts or breaks in the seat belt wires, broken or wore air bag spring/coils in the steering column.... ugh.
I'm actually beyond broke right now, juggling bills onto the new credit card I got and paid my rent - so I've got about 30$ to my name and still have car insurance (120$) and other fun bills due in a few days time. I work via my van, so no van = no money, no work. 
Your opinions are valued and if you know a guy that knows somebody who'd love to burn or steal a shit minivan for insurance purposes.. you let me know lol. Thanks for your help!"
"1998 Ford Escort Wagon - Is this a safe buy?
Hello you beautiful mechanics of redditland.
I'm currently in Canada and looking to buy a 1998 Ford Escort Wagon with 207k miles on the clock and only 2 owners part of the same family (not mine).
I went to few the car but I am a complete novice and looked at as much as I could and drove it around a car park to listen for sounds and check the brakes and power steering etc. Anyway, these are the photos:
- [Google plus gallery, sorry](https://plus.google.com/photos/111456768868629141596/albums/6108148300800060433?authkey=CLuN8Pqs6NW3bQ)
The oil looked good (not milky, no metallic flakes, nice oily color), all the fluids were filled and didn't smell funny. All the lights worked, the central locking worked, the windows worked, the tyres are all weather tyres and seem in great condition. The spare was in the boot with a jack. Nothing smelled wet or funny, and the interior was in good nick.
The VIN check is coming back showing no previous damage and it recognises the type of vehicle it is. Couple of minor dings on the rear which I knew about. It's had a new battery in the last 12 months.
My concerns are when idling there was a slight rattle sound which could be anything from the timing belt needing replaced to a loose heat shield (so google says). I'm also not sure whether to be concerned about the gunk on the underside of the car or on the suspension. Not sure what an older car should look like.
It handled fine, power steering was smooth, braked well, didn't squeak under heavy braking. Didn't make any noises going at slow speeds or doing tight figure 8s.
My gut says it's not a bad car, but then again, I am flying blind and am a complete novice at this game. I am planning on driving it 8,000 or so miles in cold weather. Just need to make sure I'm not going to be spending money on it on the way over, and that I don't break down in butt fuck nowhere!
As a driver, I always try to drive as smoothly as possible no matter what car I'm driving. I don't like putting undue pressure on the engine or anything so I'll be driving it as though there was a newborn in the back.
Any advice on the topic is muchly appreciated, thank you so much for your time.
*If you have a website and would like me to take a look at it and see what could be improved I can offer to do that in return for any knowledge and wisdom you can impart! Thanks again, Craig*"
"Can a belt fit, but be too tight?
Ive been battling squeaking sounds from my serpentine belt. Its got aftermarket parts and additional pulleys, so i had to get a different sized belt than stock. When i put the belt on, it is a snug fit with the tensioner all the way down. Could this put too much stress on the belt and cause it to break down and start squeaking? The tensioner has wobbles back and forth at idle, but ive put 2 new tensioners on it and they both do that. So the tensioner itself isnt the issue."
"2001 Dodge Neon Speedometer jumped from 50 to 80, then back again
I was driving on a highway from my place of work to my home. It was pouring, BADLY. So bad, I could barely see anything than a hazy object in front of me, which was the car in front of me. I was content on making the 18 mile drive just doing 30 mph, but traffic picked up and i figured just keep up with the car ahead and don't worry about anything else. I'm going 50 up an incline, and then all of a sudden I feel my car kind of kicking back at me. It felt like driving in winter a little bit, where I'd be driving up something and then my traction lights come on and my car isn't really moving but I can hear my tires spinning, and then I just shoot off a little bit to the side, swerving. This time felt exactly like that, but slightly different and when I looked at my dashboard, the speedometer shot to 80, and then settled back down because I took my foot off the gas and then started to break. The rest of the ride home happened without incident, but I still felt a little concerned. I'm also due for an oil change, so idk if that matters. My stepfather says I was hydroplaning, but I've never had a problem driving i the rain before, so I'm not sure what it feels like to hydroplane. Please help. "
"Lost a wheel due to shop error
We brought my fiancé’s jeep into a shop to get the breaks inspected and they forgot to put the lug nuts on or tighten them down which caused the tire to come off about a half mile down the road.  There is some damage to the fender, the rotor and the rim itself.  They have agreed to fix everything caused by this event. They are replacing the rotor and pads on the side where the wheel came off and I was wondering if I should have them also replace the rotors and pads on the other side as well for free or is that not necessary? I also wanted to know if I should get them to replace the rim? it is clear the rotor dropped on to the rim and I don’t want to find a crack later on because of this.  Finally, what else should I pay close attention to that could have been damaged to make sure it gets fixed? "
"98 Toyota Corolla 1.8L possible fuel system/vacuum leak/emissions system issues, looking for the problem. Long and detailed post!
The car is automatic, 260,000, no tach. This is my roommate's car. She's broke, so please, no advice that the car has a lot of miles on it and she just needs to get something else. The car was given to her a month ago by a family member after she was involved in a hit and run that messed up her other car pretty bad, but she still has that one. She knows she needs a new car.
The car seemed like it wasn't getting enough fuel, I would floor it to get on the freeway, but it was extremely slow acceleration. On the freeway, I had a lot of trouble maintaining 65 without almost flooring it. I could feel the car kinda of lurching while keeping a steady speed going down the highway. I couldn't really get any decent acceleration when taking it slow or punching it. Taking off from a stoplight was very hard. It would do it in city as well, not just highway, but highway felt more intense. It wouldn't always do it though, but more than 50% of the time it would act like this. It really seemed like something was clogged and having trouble letting gas passed through so I started looking for a fuel filter. Didn't find it, so I verified that it was in the tank. This got me thinking that since it wasn't doing it all the time, maybe the fuel pump is going out and its making fuel pressure go all wonky.. I go on rockauto, so I figured their cheap, lets give it a shot. Ordered the fuel pump and sock, and started work on the car when they came in. 
Changing it was real easy, absolutely no problems with installing. I primed the car for a while. Went to start it and nothing. It would turn over but wasn't getting anything. So I primed longer. I primed for over 20 min with key on engine off and still couldn't get it to start. With the backseat bench up, I turned the key while touching the top of the pump and my ear as close as possible while turning the key on engine off. I couldn't feel or hear any power so I got online and apparently the fuel pump is only supposed to kick on when the engine is cranked or running, so key on engine off wasn't doing anything for me it turns out. I was frustrated so I just waited about two hours before trying to start it again.
 After multiple cranks, I finally start getting a very small response from pumping the gas pedal while cranking, and it would die immediately. This got me real excited so I kept cranking it, the response getting slightly stronger. I finally got it started for more than a second. I had to keep pumping the gas though to keep it going cause it kept trying to die. I had to do this for half an hour before I finally got an idle. Once it was idling without me pumping the gas, I tried to give it a rev. The car sputtered out as soon as I started giving it gas. So I got it started again, and just let it idle for 10 minutes. I went to press the gas and I had to take it real slow. Too much pressure on the pedal would kill it, very slight pressure produced a rev.
I finally got it to where I could very slowly rev it high enough that I felt comfortable trying to drive it around the apartment complex. I put it in reverse and slowly pushed the pedal and it started sputtering so I let off and let it idle in park some more. I put it back in reverse and let the car pull itself out. I put it in drive and started pushing lightly on the gas and was getting a good response. Still couldn't put too much pressure without killing it, but it seemed like it was slowly working out. I finally was able to actually drive it normal, so I left the gate to go onto the road.
The moment I went through the gate it started sputtering with anything but idle. I managed to get turned around and punch in the gate code, hoping like hell that I could make it to the gate and through it in idle drive before it closed. I drove around the complex for a while, trying to give it gas, sometimes getting a good response, sometimes sputtering. I finally gave up at about 1 am and decided to be done for the night. 
I went out around 1 pm the next day to see if I could even get it to start. To my suprise, it started right up. Revved it a few times and it was perfect. I start driving the car and the response is amazing, no sputtering whatsoever. I finally leave the complex with the car and drive around for about 30 minutes. I was able to actually punch it and take off. the car was acting so much better than it was before I started messing with anything. It did great on the highway.
She got home an hour later and we took the car to get her daughter from school, making sure I rode with her in case anything happened. It took a few tries to get it started. About a quarter mile from the complex, she went to hit the gas from a stoplight, she tried to punch it taking off from the light, and the car had very little power behind it. We managed to get up onto the highway and the car very slowly got up to speed. We picked up her daughter, and came back home.
Throughout the night before, the CEL came on. After we got back to the apartment, I took the car to AutoZone to get the code. P0171, bank 1 running lean. I drive back home and its in and out a little with going well and acting up. Her husband and I cleaned the air intake sensor, cleaned up the pcv valve (both of us are now broke and know it needs replaced very badly, getting one on payday), and started spraying carb cleaner on the engine looking for vacuum leaks. He revved the car to the floor and it started acting up at idle. He stopped revving after that and was keeping the car at idle, but it was still a little rough. When I sprayed on the front of the engine, the idle evened out and stayed evened out, could not get that to replicate. We decided to leave it alone for a while. He made sure to tell her not to floor it at any time, and go easy on the accelerator pedal as she speeds up.
She took the car out in the evening and it worked like a dream, once again. She had the car out for an hour and never had an issue. So I start wondering if the heat is a problem (Phoenix AZ), and it was doing well for me earlier in the day since it was a cold start up. The next day, it took her several minutes to get the car started on a cold start up, so I ruled that out. Once she got it started she didn't have any problems for the rest of the day. Yesterday when she and my wife went out in the evening, the car got so bad with no power that they had to pull over twice. The car evened out for them after a while. She tried to take the car again today and the problem was still bad enough for her that she didn't stay out very long.
Her husband and I are wondering if there was originally bad fuel pressure from the pump with whatever the other problem is, and that was what was keeping the CEL light off. Wondering if now that the car has good fuel pressure, its making the other part react even worse and making itself more apparant, but we don't know what it is. We are considering up stream o2 sensor and intake manifold gasket as the top two possibilities, maybe a clogged injector. We also don't want to pull the plugs out just yet since old ones break so easily and we'd rather have them available before taking them out.
I get paid Wed and am off Wed and Thur and will be working on it all day both days. Thought I'd come to Reddit and ask you all if you had any other ideas of what I need to look at before I go out there. Any help would be greatly appreciated!
UPDATE: Have noticed the exhaust smells slightly like vinegar and started noticing the sound of back firing. It's acting the same way as the first night now. Pump a lot to get it started, pump a lot to keep it rubbing, then when it can handle idling without pumping, have to idle for a while as accelerator pedal being pushed chokes the car. Then after letting it idle, can slowly work my way up to revving.
Carb cleaner did not help this time, so it was just a coincidence last time, and unplugging the upstream o2 sensor makes zero difference."
"1997/1998 Cadillac Eldorado breaking down over 5 times in the past 2 years with the same mechanic?
First time poster here. 
My dad is infatuated with his 1997-1998 Cadillac Eldorado. He insists that he keeps driving it even though the engine dies randomly. He'll put it into park, turn off the car and it just won't turn on again. 
He has taken it to his mechanic to get it checked but the problem always comes back. Every single time it's stopped, he would call the same mechanic. 
My question... is it normal for ""old"" cars to break down several times in such a short amount of time? Or is the mechanic just trying to juice my dad's wallet? 
My dad has only done basic maintenance (and probably some fixes) and my mom and I are suspecting that his mechanic is not really doing a great job. We have our reasons of not trusting him... and my dad is just one of those gullible people. I understand that sometimes cars can get old and somehow stop working. But if it gets it's basic maintenance and checked up at a mechanic, I feel like this problem shouldn't happen as often as it does. What I'm basically trying to get at is if my mom and I should convince our dad to try a new mechanic. 
Thank you in advanced!

"1989 Suburban with TBI 350. Milky oil, rough idle, low compression, loosing coolant
I'm going to preface this by saying that I work out of town and am not near the truck most of the time.  About 3 weeks ago, I was driving to my parent's land and started smelling antifreeze, I looked down and saw a small trickle coming out of my heater core.  I was in the middle of nowhere and kept an eye on my temperature gauge and made it into the next town without the car heating up, when the temperature started to climb, I shut the engine down.  According to the gauge it was running while hot for maybe 10 seconds. 
I bypassed the heater, refilled it with coolant and went about my day and drove it about 100 miles without incident (temperature was right at 180 or 190 I think).  
I get it back to Houston, the Suburban is idling rough.  I check some things but end up having to drive back to work and drop the truck in a shop.  I also notice a very slight leak where the heater hoses are joined (where I bypassed it).  The mechanic calls me up and tells me that the engine has 85lbs of compression on one bank and the engine is shot and needs rebuilding.  
I start looking around for new engines and pick the truck up last Saturday while I was back in town.  I get the truck home and figure I'll check the coolant level.  It's low (about three pitchers low).  I check the oil and notice that it is milky as all hell (it wasn't when I dropped it off at the shop two weeks prior) and I'm smoking out of my driver side exhaust (it has true dual exhaust).  
I call the mechanic back and he explains that he compression tested and did a leak down test on the passenger side of the engine (apparently stopped when he found the 85lbs of compression across all 4 cylinders).  When I told him about the milky oil, he explained that if it had been sitting for awhile (2 weeks) the condensate could have gotten into the oil. It was clean when I dropped it off and all the cars he has for sale are the same way as they don't get driven often.  I don't think that is accurate.  Granted the aircleaner was off the car, but the hood was down and there's a lot of water, the driver side bank is smoking, and I'm loosing more coolant than I think I would through that tiny assed leak in the heater hose.  Oil doesn't just turn milky if you let a car sit for a few weeks.  
I'm thinking I either have a cracked head or a blown headgasket on the driver's side and my low compression may have been caused by all the water in the oil (it breaks down the viscosity of the oil around the rings and would lower the compression).  
I'm contemplating changing the oil, digging my compression gauge out and checking the compression on the passenger side bank.  If the compression comes up, I'd then pull and inspect the heads and the headgasket.  Am I barking up the wrong tree here or does that make some sense?  "
"1995 Camaro. I don't know where to begin, but I'll try.
This is my first post on MechanicAdvice.  
Background: When I bought my 1995, 3.4 V6 Camaro it had 55,000 miles on it but a little rust on the bottom.
Last summer while driving normally, I hit the breaks to slow down for a hill.  My pedal started to break and then went immediately to the floor.  Simultaneously, my ABS INOP light came on.  In a panic, I pumped the breaks and the light came off and the breaks returned.  Soon after, I pulled the ABS fuse.  Before driving again this summer (I'm in college, so it sits during the school year), I put the ABS fuse back in.  Well, in normal driving conditions about a week ago, the same thing happened.  ABS INOP -- LOST BREAKS -- Pumping -- breaks are back.
Now, the pedal feels a little mushy.  We changed the master cylinder twice in the last three years, but recently I noticed in the Haynes Manual that it says this repair should be done by a professional because of the Traction Control.
SECOND PROBLEM:
Rememer I said rust?  Well apparently the shit has spread like wildfire.  I got my oil changed somewhere a couple weeks ago and they mentioned that my cradle is almost rusted though.  I'd like to get under the car myself to take a look at it, maybe weld some support material.  
Unfortunately, I leave for college Thursday and I need to drive my car in a city.
Any ideas what I should do to drive in the short term?  The car only has 79,000 miles on it..
She's too young to die."
"Help with cleaning various engine components and the cylinder heads
I have a 2000 Ford Expedition 5.4L and I am doing a top end rebuild by myself due to blown head gaskets. I have 195K on the engine and I bought it fairly recently so I have no idea of past maintenance or upkeep. I am going to be replacing the head gaskets, plugs, igniters, and all the gaskets I come across. As I'm pulling things off i'm coming to realizing that the head gaskets were not the main problem. The entire throttle body is clogged up, the iac is pretty bad, and generally my engine is just terribly dirty. I've used TB cleaner and gotten the TB cleaned up pretty good and I used some TB cleaner on the iac as well. 
My question is what can I use to clean the TB to factory condition, like no carbon buildup at all.
Also, how do I clean the egr? Everyone says it needs to be cleaned, but I don't know how.
I have the fuel injectors removed, is there anyway to clean them outside of the engine?
The entire Intake manifold is disgusting and I've used some brake cleaner, but it doesn't seem to be making a huge difference. What can I clean it with?
I am obviously going to have the heads machined flat, but they need to be cleaned thoroughly as well. I don't have a huge budget so I would like to clean it myself. Is this a plausible thing to do and what would I be using to clean it?
Is there a good concentrated solvent that I can dilute in a bucket and soak bolts and various smaller parts in?
I pulled my coolant crossover off and it, along with the rest of my coolant system is ridiculously dirty and almost rusty looking. Is there something I can do while the engine is dismantled or should I just do a coolant flush once its reassembled. 
Is there anything else that I can/should clean while I have everything torn down? Anything that is common to break or deteriorate? I'm almost at 200k so should I be doing the 200k routine maintenance as well? 
Sorry for all the questions, but i'm trying to do this right so that I don't have to do it again. Thanks everybody!"

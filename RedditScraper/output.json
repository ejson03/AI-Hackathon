"[{'text': ['Hey everyone,', 'I own a mechanic shop and one night before closing this dude comes in for an oil change. He has a 2012 Mercedes C250. All we did was a simple oil change. Drain, fill and replace filter. After turning the vehicle on right away the engine starts making a rattling sound, the check engine line turns on. We spent about a good hour trying to figure out what was going on. So we told the guy to bring it back when it’s not late. Then the noise goes away, and he finally drives off. Calls me back and says the noise is back and now his car is jerking and acting funny. Told him to bring it back it never does. A week later I get a call from his mechanic saying “yea man looks like your oil changed damaged his cam sprockets” and I’m like huh? How are you about to make that assumption. Anyway this guy is getting mad he calls threatening us saying he’s gonna sue us, I’ve told him multiple times saying “just bring the car to us” and he never does. Month goes buy bureau of automotive repair gets involved. He’s going back and forth trying to mediate the situation. After investigating for a few weeks he says the same thing “yea so we don’t know if the cam sprockets are damaged, or the  actuators that power them, so it’s better off just replacing the motor” at this point I’m being bullied, and being intimidated into believing my oil changed caused this.

Now the issue is, I have to double clutch when shifting because the transmission won't engage. I know about these issues by the way because the seller mentioned it. So here I am, with a good car that's in sh*t condition. My choices are: Selling the Car or doing a clutch job. I really love the car but I don't know how a clutch job approximately costs. I talked to the buyer again, he said he wasn't sure if it's either the flywheel or the clutch. The car howls when its stationary, you have to double clutch to shift into gears(or it won't let you shift), and it takes full manpower to shift it. The body is in good condition, the clutch(or the flywheel) is the only issue. \\nSo Thanks again for reading my post! If you guys could give me a suggestion, I would be really grateful.

In the process of that i cross threaded the bolt that holds the pully on, and basically totally fucked the alternator up, and it was unable to hold the pully.
